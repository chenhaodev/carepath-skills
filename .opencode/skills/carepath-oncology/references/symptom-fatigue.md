# Cancer-Related Fatigue (CRF) - Symptom Management Pathway

## Objective
Manage cancer-related fatigue (CRF) to maintain quality of life and functional status. CRF is the most common and distressing side effect of cancer treatment, distinct from normal tiredness as it is not relieved by rest.

## Duration
**Ongoing** throughout treatment and survivorship

## Grading & Severity (CTCAE v5.0)

| Grade | Description | Impact on ADL |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| **Grade 1** | Fatigue relieved by rest | No significant interference |
| **Grade 2** | Fatigue **NOT** relieved by rest | Limiting instrumental ADL (cooking, shopping) |
| **Grade 3** | Severe fatigue | Limiting self-care ADL (bathing, dressing) |

---

## Assessment Protocol

### Clinical Assessment
- **Onset & Pattern**: Relation to chemotherapy cycles (nadir vs cumulative)
- **Severity**: 0-10 scale (0=No fatigue, 10=Worst imaginable)
- **Impact**: Interference with daily activities and sleep
- **History**: Treatment regimen, current medications, sleep patterns

### Contributing Factors (The "Treatable Few")
1. **Anemia**: Check Hemoglobin (Hgb)
2. **Endocrine**: Hypothyroidism (TSH), Hypogonadism
3. **Psychological**: Depression, Anxiety (Screen with PHQ-9/GAD-7)
4. **Sleep Disturbance**: Insomnia, Sleep Apnea
5. **Pain**: Uncontrolled pain drains energy
6. **Nutritional**: Dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, malnutrition
7. **Deconditioning**: Muscle loss from inactivity

## Management Strategy

### 1. Treat Reversible Causes
- **Anemia**: Transfusion if Hgb <7-8 g/dL or symptomatic; ESAs (if palliative intent)
- **Hypothyroidism**: Levothyroxine replacement
- **Pain/Depression/Sleep**: Optimize management of comorbidities
- **Nutrition**: Hydration, dietitian referral

### 2. Non-Pharmacologic Interventions (First-Line)
- **Exercise Program (Level 1 Evidence)**:
  - **Most effective intervention** for CRF
  - Goal: 150 min moderate activity/week (walking, resistance training)
  - Start low, go slow (e.g., 5-10 min walks)
- **Energy Conservation**:
  - "The 4 Ps": Prioritize, Plan, Pace, Position
  - Schedule activities during peak energy times
- **Sleep Hygiene**: Regular schedule, limit naps <30 min
- **Psychosocial**: CBT for fatigue, mindfulness-based stress reduction

### 3. Pharmacologic Interventions (Second-Line)
- **Psychostimulants**: Methylphenidate (Ritalin)
  - Consider for severe fatigue (Grade 3) or end-of-life
  - Contraindications: Arrhythmias, severe anxiety, uncontrolled HTN
- **Corticosteroids**: Dexamethasone (short-term use only, e.g., end-of-life)

## Monitoring & Follow-Up

### Daily/Weekly Patient Tasks
- **Fatigue Diary**: Rate 0-10 daily, note peak/trough times
- **Activity Log**: Track minutes of exercise/activity
- **Sleep Log**: Hours slept, quality rating

### Clinical Team Review
- **Weekly**: Review fatigue scores and activity levels
- **Monthly**: Re-assess contributing factors (CBC, TSH if indicated)

---

## Alert Thresholds

| Parameter | Threshold | Action |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| **Fatigue Score** | ≥7/10 (Severe) | **Urgent Review**: Screen for reversible causes (infection, anemia, dehydration) |
| **Functional Status** | New inability to perform self-care | **Clinical Evaluation**: Rule out disease progression or acute event |
| **Associated Symptoms** | SOB, chest pain, dizziness | **Immediate Evaluation**: Rule out PE, cardiac ischemia, severe anemia |

---

## Comorbidity Considerations

### Depression vs. Fatigue
- **Overlap**: Low energy, psychomotor retardation
- **Distinction**: Depression includes anhedonia, hopelessness, guilt. Fatigue alone preserves interest but lacks energy.
- **Action**: If PHQ-9 ≥10, treat depression concurrently.

### CHF vs. Cancer Fatigue
- **CHF**: Worsens with exertion, associated with dyspnea/edema.
- **Cancer**: Constant, not relieved by rest.
- **Action**: Monitor weight and BNP if history of CHF.

---

## Patient Education
- **"Rest makes it worse"**: Prolonged inactivity leads to muscle wasting and more fatigue.
- **Permission to rest**: Balance activity with short naps (power naps).
- **Hydration**: Dehydration mimics fatigue.
- **Communication**: Report fatigue levels to care team; do not assume it's "just part of cancer."
