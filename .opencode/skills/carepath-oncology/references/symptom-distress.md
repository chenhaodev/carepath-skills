# Psychological Distress (Anxiety, Depression, Sleep) - Symptom Management Pathway

## Objective
Screen, identify, and manage psychological distress, depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbances in cancer patients. Distress is a "sixth vital sign" in oncology and requires proactive management.

## Duration
**Ongoing** throughout treatment and survivorship

## Assessment Tools & Scoring

### 1. NCCN Distress Thermometer
- **Scale**: 0 (No distress) to 10 (Extreme distress)
- **Threshold**: Score **≥4** indicates clinically significant distress requiring assessment.

### 2. PHQ-9 (Depression Screening)
| Score | Severity | Action |
|-------|----------|--------|
| 0-4 | None/Minimal | Monitor |
| 5-9 | Mild | Psychoeducation, support |
| 10-14 | Moderate | Consider pharmacotherapy/psychotherapy |
| 15-19 | Moderately Severe | Active treatment required |
| 20-27 | Severe | **Urgent Psychiatry Referral** |

### 3. GAD-7 (Anxiety Screening)
| Score | Severity | Action |
|-------|----------|--------|
| 0-4 | None/Minimal | Monitor |
| 5-9 | Mild | Psychoeducation, relaxation techniques |
| 10-14 | Moderate | Consider pharmacotherapy/CBT |
| 15-21 | Severe | **Urgent Psychiatry Referral** |

### 4. C-SSRS (Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale) - **CRITICAL**
- **Screening Questions**:
  1. Have you wished you were dead?
  2. Have you had thoughts of killing yourself?
  3. Have you thought about how you might do this? (Method)
  4. Have you had some intention of acting on thoughts? (Intent)
  5. Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? (Plan)

### 5. Sleep Efficiency
- **Calculation**: (Total Sleep Time / Time in Bed) × 100%
- **Goal**: >85%

## Suicide Risk Response Protocol (CRITICAL SAFETY)

### 🔴 HIGH RISK (Emergency)
- **Criteria**: Suicidal ideation with **Plan AND Intent** (C-SSRS Q4 or Q5 "Yes"), or recent attempt.
- **Action**:
  1. **DO NOT LEAVE PATIENT ALONE**.
  2. **Call 911 / Ambulance** for transport to Emergency Department.
  3. Notify attending physician immediately.
  4. Notify family/emergency contact.

### 🟠 MODERATE RISK (Urgent)
- **Criteria**: Suicidal ideation with **Method** but **NO Plan/Intent** (C-SSRS Q3 "Yes", Q4/Q5 "No").
- **Action**:
  1. **Same-day Psychiatry/Psychology Consult**.
  2. Establish **Safety Plan** (remove means, identify support).
  3. Ensure patient is not left alone until evaluated.
  4. Notify family/support system.

### 🟡 LOW RISK (Routine)
- **Criteria**: Passive ideation ("wish I were dead") without method/plan/intent (C-SSRS Q1/Q2 "Yes", Q3-5 "No").
- **Action**:
  1. Referral to MSW (Medical Social Worker) or Psychologist.
  2. Follow-up within 48 hours.
  3. Provide crisis hotline numbers (988).

## Management Strategy

### 1. Psychological Distress (General)
- **Mild (Distress <4, PHQ/GAD <10)**:
  - Psychoeducation, peer support groups.
  - Relaxation techniques (breathing, meditation).
- **Moderate/Severe (Distress ≥4, PHQ/GAD ≥10)**:
  - **Psychotherapy**: CBT, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT).
  - **Pharmacotherapy**: SSRIs (Escitalopram, Sertraline), SNRIs (Venlafaxine - also helps hot flashes/neuropathy).
  - **Referral**: Psycho-oncology, Psychiatry, Social Work.

### 2. Sleep Management
- **Sleep Hygiene (First-Line)**:
  - Consistent wake time.
  - Bed is for sleep and sex ONLY (stimulus control).
  - Limit caffeine/screens.
- **Treat Underlying Causes**:
  - Pain (analgesics), Anxiety (anxiolytics), Steroids (take before noon).
- **Pharmacologic**:
  - Melatonin (3-5mg).
  - Trazodone (25-50mg).
  - **Avoid Benzodiazepines** for chronic sleep issues (fall risk, delirium).

## Monitoring & Follow-Up

### Daily/Weekly Patient Tasks
- **Mood Log**: Rate mood/anxiety daily.
- **Sleep Log**: Bedtime, wake time, interruptions.

### Clinical Team Review
- **Weekly**: Review PHQ-9/GAD-7 scores if elevated.
- **Every Visit**: Distress Thermometer screening.

## Alert Thresholds

| Parameter | Threshold | Action |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| **Suicide Risk** | Any active ideation | **ACTIVATE SUICIDE PROTOCOL** (See above) |
| **PHQ-9 / GAD-7** | Score ≥15 | **Urgent Referral**: Psychiatry/Psychology within 1 week |
| **Distress** | Score ≥7 | **Priority Referral**: Social work/Counseling |
| **Sleep** | <4 hours/night | **Clinical Review**: Assess for delirium, steroid psychosis, uncontrolled pain |

## Comorbidity Considerations

### Depression + Pain
- **Bidirectional**: Pain worsens depression; depression lowers pain threshold.
- **Action**: Treat BOTH simultaneously. SNRIs (Duloxetine, Venlafaxine) treat both pain and depression.

### Anxiety + Dyspnea
- **Cycle**: Anxiety causes shortness of breath → panic → worse dyspnea.
- **Action**: Treat underlying respiratory cause + consider low-dose benzodiazepine (Lorazepam) or SSRI for anxiety component.

### Delirium vs. Depression
- **Hypoactive Delirium**: Can mimic depression (withdrawn, quiet).
- **Differentiation**: Delirium has **fluctuating consciousness** and **inattention**.
- **Action**: If confused/disoriented, evaluate for medical causes (infection, meds, metabolic) - DO NOT just start antidepressant.

## Patient Education
- **"It's not just in your head"**: Distress is a chemical and physiological response to cancer.
- **Safety Planning**: Keep crisis numbers saved in phone.
- **Medication Myths**: Antidepressants are not "happy pills" and are not addictive; they restore chemical balance.
