# Constipation - Oncology Symptom Pathway

## Objective
Prevent bowel obstruction, impaction, and patient distress caused by opioid use, chemotherapy (e.g., vinca alkaloids), or immobility in cancer patients.

## Duration
**Throughout active treatment** (Especially while on opioids)

---

## Eligibility Criteria

### Inclusion
- Patients on **opioid therapy** (morphine, oxycodone, fentanyl, etc.)
- Patients receiving constipating chemotherapy (vincristine, vinblastine) or antiemetics (5-HT3 antagonists)
- Patients reporting decreased bowel movement frequency or difficulty passing stool

### Exclusion Criteria
- **Bowel Obstruction** (mechanical) - confirmed by imaging
- **Ileus** (paralytic)
- **Acute Abdomen** (perforation risk)

---

## Primary Outcome Measures

| Outcome | Timeframe | Target |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| **Bowel Function** | Daily | BM at least every 2 days (or patient baseline) |
| **Symptom Control** | Daily | Soft stool, easy to pass (Bristol Type 3-4) |
| **Prevention** | Continuous | Avoid impaction/obstruction |
| **Unplanned Utilization** | 30 days | Minimize ED visits for severe constipation |

---

## Devices & Monitoring Equipment

See **[Devices Reference](../../shared/devices.md)** for detailed specifications.

### Required Devices
- None specific (Symptom diary is primary tool)

### Optional Devices
- **Activity Tracker**
  - Monitor mobility (immobility worsens constipation)

---

## Daily Monitoring Protocol

### Clinical Team Reviews (Daily/Every 2-3 Days)
1. **Subjective Patient Data Review**
   - **Last Bowel Movement**: Date and time
   - **Stool Consistency**: Hard/lumpy vs soft (Bristol Stool Chart)
   - **Straining**: Difficulty passing stool?
   - **Associated Symptoms**: Abdominal pain, bloating, nausea, overflow diarrhea

2. **Patient Task Compliance Review**
   - Laxative adherence (taking prophylactic bowel regimen?)
   - Fluid intake (>1.5-2L/day)
   - Fiber intake (if appropriate - caution in obstruction risk)

---

## Alert Thresholds & Escalations

See **[Universal Alert Thresholds](../../shared/alert-thresholds.md)** for complete threshold table.

### CTCAE Grading (v5.0) - Constipation

| Grade | Description | Clinical Significance | Action |
|-------|-------------|-----------------------|--------|
| **Grade 1** | Occasional or intermittent symptoms; occasional use of stool softeners/laxatives | Mild | **Advisory**: Increase fluids/fiber, start mild laxative |
| **Grade 2** | Persistent symptoms with regular use of laxatives or enemas; limiting instrumental ADL | Moderate | **Urgent**: Escalate bowel regimen (stimulant + osmotic) |
| **Grade 3** | Obstipation with manual evacuation indicated; limiting self care ADL | Severe | **Critical**: **Clinic/Home Visit** for enema/disimpaction or Methylnaltrexone |
| **Grade 4** | Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated | Life-Threatening | **Emergency**: Immediate ED transfer (obstruction/perforation) |

### Symptom-Specific Red Flags
- **No BM >3 days**: High risk for impaction
- **Severe Abdominal Pain**: Cramping is common, but constant severe pain suggests obstruction
- **Nausea/Vomiting**: Suggests obstruction/ileus
- **Overflow Diarrhea**: Liquid stool leaking around hard impaction
- **Absence of Flatus**: Complete obstruction

---

## Care Coordination

### Telemedicine/Virtual Visits
- **Check-in** if no BM for 3 days
- **Medication Review**: Adjust opioid bowel regimen

### Interdisciplinary Task Management
- **Nursing**: Digital rectal exam (if trained/home visit), administration of enema
- **Palliative Care**: Consult for complex opioid rotation or refractory constipation

---

## Treatment Protocol

### Prophylaxis (The "Mush and Push" Strategy)
- **Standard for Opioid Users**:
  - **Stool Softener**: Docusate Sodium 100mg BID ("Mush")
  - **Stimulant**: Senna 2 tabs at bedtime ("Push") OR Bisacodyl 5-10mg daily

### Stepwise Management
1. **Step 1 (Mild/Prophylaxis)**:
   - Ensure adequate fluid intake.
   - Senna + Docusate daily.
   - Polyethylene Glycol (PEG/Miralax) 17g daily.

2. **Step 2 (No BM for 2 days)**:
   - Increase Senna to 2 tabs BID (max 4-8 tabs/day).
   - Increase PEG to BID.
   - Add Magnesium Hydroxide (Milk of Magnesia) 30ml (if no renal failure).
   - Add Lactulose 15-30ml BID.

3. **Step 3 (No BM for 3+ days / Refractory)**:
   - **Rectal Measures**: Bisacodyl suppository or Glycerin suppository.
   - **Enema**: Fleet enema or Tap water enema (avoid phosphate enemas in renal failure).
   - **Opioid Antagonist**: Methylnaltrexone (Relistor) SC injection (for opioid-induced constipation only - rule out obstruction first).
   - **Manual Disimpaction**: If stool is palpable in rectal vault.

---

## Complications to Monitor

### Bowel Obstruction
- Nausea, vomiting, abdominal distension, no flatus
- **Action**: NPO, NG tube, Surgical consult (Emergency)

### Fecal Impaction
- Rectal pressure, overflow diarrhea
- **Action**: Digital disimpaction, enemas

### Perforation
- Sudden severe pain, rigid abdomen
- **Action**: Emergency surgery

---

## Comorbidity Considerations

See **[Comorbidity Matrix](../../shared/comorbidity-matrix.md)** for detailed guidance.

- **Renal Failure**: Avoid Magnesium-based laxatives (Milk of Magnesia) and Phosphate enemas. Stick to Senna/PEG.
- **Neutropenia/Thrombocytopenia**: Avoid rectal manipulation (suppositories/enemas/DRE) due to risk of infection/bleeding. Use aggressive oral regimen or Methylnaltrexone.
- **Hypercalcemia**: Causes severe constipation. Treat underlying calcium level (hydration/bisphosphonates).
