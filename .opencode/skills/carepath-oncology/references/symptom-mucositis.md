# Mucositis (Oral) - Oncology Symptom Pathway

## Objective
Manage oral mucositis (stomatitis) to maintain nutritional intake, control pain, and prevent secondary infection in patients receiving chemotherapy or head/neck radiation.

## Duration
**Throughout active treatment** (Typically peaks 7-14 days post-chemo/radiation)

---

## Eligibility Criteria

### Inclusion
- Patients receiving **stomatotoxic chemotherapy** (e.g., 5-FU, Methotrexate, Doxorubicin, Cytarabine)
- Patients receiving **Head & Neck Radiation**
- Patients undergoing **Stem Cell Transplant**
- Reports of mouth pain, sores, or difficulty swallowing

### Exclusion Criteria
- **Esophageal obstruction** (requires GI eval)
- **Dental abscess** (requires dental eval)

---

## Primary Outcome Measures

| Outcome | Timeframe | Target |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| **Pain Control** | Daily | Pain score <4/10, able to swallow |
| **Nutritional Status** | Daily | Maintain weight, adequate caloric intake |
| **Infection Prevention** | Daily | No secondary fungal/viral/bacterial infection |
| **Unplanned Utilization** | 30 days | Minimize admissions for dehydration/pain |

---

## Devices & Monitoring Equipment

See **[Devices Reference](../../shared/devices.md)** for detailed specifications.

### Required Devices
- **Connected Weight Scale**
  - Monitor for weight loss due to poor intake
- **Thermometer**
  - Monitor for fever (oral flora can cause sepsis in neutropenia)

### Optional Devices
- **Flashlight/Mirror**
  - For patient self-exam of oral cavity

---

## Daily Monitoring Protocol

### Clinical Team Reviews (Daily)
1. **Subjective Patient Data Review**
   - **Mouth Pain Score**: 0-10 scale
   - **Oral Intake**: Ability to eat/drink (Solids vs Liquids vs Nothing)
   - **Swallowing**: Dysphagia or odynophagia?
   - **Bleeding**: Any blood when brushing/rinsing?

2. **Patient Task Compliance Review**
   - Oral hygiene frequency (rinses 4-6x/day)
   - Analgesic use before meals

## Alert Thresholds & Escalations

See **[Universal Alert Thresholds](../../shared/alert-thresholds.md)** for complete threshold table.

### CTCAE Grading (v5.0) - Mucositis Oral

| Grade | Description | Clinical Significance | Action |
|-------|-------------|-----------------------|--------|
| **Grade 1** | Asymptomatic or mild symptoms; intervention not indicated | Mild | **Advisory**: Saline rinses, soft toothbrush, avoid irritants |
| **Grade 2** | Moderate pain; not interfering with oral intake; modified diet indicated | Moderate | **Urgent**: Magic mouthwash, topical analgesics, soft diet |
| **Grade 3** | Severe pain; interfering with oral intake | Severe | **Critical**: **Clinic/Hospital** for IV fluids, systemic opioids, nutritional support |
| **Grade 4** | Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated | Life-Threatening | **Emergency**: Immediate admission (airway concern if severe edema) |

### Symptom-Specific Red Flags
- **Inability to swallow liquids**: Risk of severe dehydration
- **Fever**: >38°C (Oral source sepsis risk)
- **Bleeding**: Spontaneous or uncontrollable oral bleeding (check platelets)
- **White patches**: Candidiasis (Thrush)
- **Herpetic lesions**: HSV reactivation

---

## Care Coordination

### Telemedicine/Virtual Visits
- **Video Exam**: Inspect oral cavity for ulcers, thrush, or bleeding
- **Pain Management**: Titrate opioids if topical agents insufficient

### Interdisciplinary Task Management
- **Dietitian**: Recommendations for high-calorie liquids/soft foods
- **Dentist**: Pre-treatment evaluation, management of dental complications
- **Infusion**: IV hydration/TPN if Grade 3-4

---

## Treatment Protocol

### Oral Hygiene (The Foundation)
- **Rinses**: Salt & Soda rinse (1 tsp salt + 1 tsp baking soda in 1L water) 4-6 times daily.
- **Avoid**: Alcohol-based mouthwashes (drying/painful).
- **Brushing**: Ultra-soft toothbrush, air dry brush.
- **Flossing**: Discontinue if platelets <40k or bleeding occurs.

### Pain Management
1. **Topical**:
   - "Magic Mouthwash" (Lidocaine + Maalox + Diphenhydramine) swish and spit/swallow q4-6h.
   - Gelclair / MuGard (mucosal barriers).
   - Topical Lidocaine viscous.
2. **Systemic**:
   - Acetaminophen/NSAIDs (caution with platelets/bleeding risk).
   - Opioids (Oxycodone, Morphine) often required for Grade 2-3. PCA pump for severe cases.

### Infection Management
- **Fungal**: Nystatin swish & swallow or Fluconazole PO for thrush.
- **Viral**: Acyclovir/Valacyclovir for HSV.
- **Bacterial**: Antibiotics if signs of cellulitis/sepsis.

### Cryotherapy (Prevention)
- **Ice Chips**: Chew on ice chips 5 min before and 30 min during bolus 5-FU or Melphalan infusion (vasoconstriction reduces drug delivery to mucosa).

---

## Complications to Monitor

### Secondary Infection
- Candidiasis, HSV, Bacterial sepsis
- **Action**: Culture and treat specifically

### Malnutrition / Dehydration
- Weight loss >5-10%
- **Action**: NG tube or PEG tube feeding (early intervention for Head & Neck radiation), IV fluids

### Airway Compromise
- Rare, but possible with severe edema in Head & Neck radiation
- **Action**: Emergency airway management

---

## Comorbidity Considerations

See **[Comorbidity Matrix](../../shared/comorbidity-matrix.md)** for detailed guidance.

- **Diabetes**: High risk for fungal infections (thrush). Poor wound healing.
- **Neutropenia**: High risk of sepsis from oral flora. Fever + Mucositis = Emergency Antibiotics.
- **Thrombocytopenia**: Bleeding risk. Use toothette instead of brush. No flossing.

---

## Transition Criteria

### Resolution Criteria
- ✅ Pain controlled with oral meds (or off meds)
- ✅ Able to eat/drink adequate calories/fluids
- ✅ Mucosa healing (ulcers resolved)
- ✅ No signs of infection
