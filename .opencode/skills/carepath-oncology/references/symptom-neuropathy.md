# Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy (CIPN) - Symptom Management Pathway

## Objective
Detect and manage Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy (CIPN) to prevent falls, maintain functional independence, and determine need for treatment dose modifications.

## Duration
**Ongoing** during neurotoxic chemotherapy and up to 6-12 months post-treatment

## Grading & Severity (CTCAE v5.0)

| Grade | Description | Impact on ADL |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| **Grade 1** | Asymptomatic; loss of deep tendon reflexes or paresthesia | No interference with function |
| **Grade 2** | Moderate symptoms; limiting instrumental ADL | Limiting cooking, shopping, typing |
| **Grade 3** | Severe symptoms; limiting self-care ADL | Limiting bathing, dressing, buttoning shirts |
| **Grade 4** | Life-threatening consequences | Urgent intervention indicated |

## Assessment Protocol

### Clinical Assessment
- **Sensory**: "Glove and stocking" distribution numbness, tingling, burning, pain, temperature sensitivity
- **Motor**: Weakness, cramping, foot drop, difficulty holding objects
- **Autonomic**: Constipation, urinary retention, orthostatic hypotension
- **Functional**: Buttoning shirts, picking up coins, walking stability

### High-Risk Agents
- **Platinum Drugs**: Cisplatin, Oxaliplatin (cold sensitivity), Carboplatin
- **Taxanes**: Paclitaxel, Docetaxel
- **Vinca Alkaloids**: Vincristine, Vinblastine
- **Proteasome Inhibitors**: Bortezomib
- **Immunomodulators**: Thalidomide

## Management Strategy

### 1. Prevention & Modification
- **Dose Modification**: The **only proven disease-modifying intervention**.
  - Grade 2 (Persistent): Consider dose reduction.
  - Grade 3: Hold treatment until recovery to Grade ≤1; consider discontinuation.
- **Cryotherapy**: Cold gloves/socks during taxane infusion (prevention).

### 2. Symptomatic Treatment (Pain Management)
- **First-Line**:
  - **Duloxetine**: Only agent with moderate evidence for CIPN pain. Start 30mg daily x 1 week, then 60mg daily.
- **Second-Line** (Limited evidence, extrapolated from diabetic neuropathy):
  - **Gabapentin**: Titrate slowly (100mg TID → 300mg TID → up to 900mg TID).
  - **Pregabalin**: 50-75mg BID initially.
  - **Topical**: Menthol, Lidocaine patches.
- **Avoid**: Opioids (ineffective for neuropathic pain), Vitamin B supplements (no evidence for prevention, potential harm).

### 3. Safety & Fall Prevention (CRITICAL)
- **Home Safety**: Remove rugs, improve lighting, install grab bars.
- **Assistive Devices**: Cane/walker if balance impaired.
- **Foot Care**: Inspect feet daily (loss of sensation = risk of undetected injury).
- **Cold Avoidance**: Specifically for Oxaliplatin (avoid cold drinks, cold air).

## Monitoring & Follow-Up

### Daily/Weekly Patient Tasks
- **Symptom Log**: Rate numbness/pain (0-10).
- **Functional Check**: Can you button a shirt? Can you feel the ground when walking?
- **Fall Reporting**: Report ANY falls or near-misses immediately.

### Clinical Team Review
- **Pre-Chemo Assessment**: Mandatory neuro check before each cycle of neurotoxic agents.
- **"Ask the 3 Questions"**:
  1. Do you have numbness/tingling in fingers or toes?
  2. Do you have trouble buttoning buttons?
  3. Have you stumbled or fallen?

## Alert Thresholds & Red Flags

| Parameter | Threshold | Action |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| **Acute Onset** | Rapid progression (<24 hrs) | **URGENT**: Rule out Guillain-Barré Syndrome or spinal cord compression |
| **Motor Weakness** | Foot drop, inability to stand | **URGENT**: Neurology consult, hold chemotherapy |
| **Autonomic** | Severe constipation, urinary retention | **Clinical Review**: Manage bowel/bladder, consider medication change |
| **Functional** | Grade 3 (Self-care limited) | **Hold Treatment**: Discuss dose reduction/discontinuation with oncologist |
| **Falls** | Any fall | **Safety Evaluation**: PT/OT referral, home safety assessment |

---

## Comorbidity Considerations

### Diabetes
- **Double Hit**: Pre-existing diabetic neuropathy + CIPN = severe progression.
- **Action**: Aggressive glucose control, earlier dose modification.

### Renal Dysfunction
- **Risk**: Increased accumulation of gabapentin/pregabalin.
- **Action**: Dose adjust renal-cleared medications.

---

## Patient Education
- **Reporting is Protection**: Reporting symptoms early prevents permanent nerve damage.
- **Safety First**: Use night lights, wear sturdy shoes (no flip-flops), test water temperature with elbow (not hand).
- **Oxaliplatin Specifics**: Avoid cold fluids/ice for 3-5 days post-infusion to prevent laryngospasm sensation.
