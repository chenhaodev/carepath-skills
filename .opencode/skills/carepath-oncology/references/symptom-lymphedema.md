# Abnormal Swelling (Lymphedema) - Oncology Care Pathway

## Objective
Prevent progression of cancer-related lymphedema (surgical/radiation-induced) through early detection, grading, and intervention. **Lymphedema is IRREVERSIBLE**; early management is critical to maintain function and quality of life.

## Grading (CTCAE v5.0)

| Grade | Clinical Description | Functional Impact |
|-------|----------------------|-------------------|
| **Grade 1** | Trace thickening or faint discoloration | Asymptomatic; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated |
| **Grade 2** | Marked discoloration; leathery skin texture; papillary formation | Limiting instrumental ADL (e.g., shopping, cooking) |
| **Grade 3** | Severe symptoms; limiting self-care ADL | Limiting self-care ADL (e.g., bathing, dressing); elective operative intervention indicated |

## Assessment & Monitoring

### Clinical Assessment
- **Limb Circumference**: Measure at consistent landmarks (e.g., 10cm above/below olecranon or patella). Compare to unaffected limb.
- **Pitting vs. Non-Pitting**: Press thumb for 10-15 seconds.
  - *Pitting*: Indentation remains (early stage).
  - *Non-Pitting*: No indentation (fibrosis/late stage).
- **Skin Changes**: Check for thickening (Stemmer's sign), discoloration, papillomas, hyperkeratosis.

### Risk Factors
- **Surgery**: Axillary or inguinal lymph node dissection/sampling.
- **Radiation**: Treatment to nodal regions (axilla, groin, pelvis).
- **Infection**: History of cellulitis/erysipelas in the limb.
- **Obesity**: BMI > 30 increases risk.

## Management Protocol

### Grade 1 (Mild)
- **Education**: **CRITICAL**. See Patient Education section.
- **Skin Care**: Daily moisturizing (pH neutral), injury prevention.
- **Compression**: Consider prophylactic compression garments (Class I: 20-30 mmHg) during air travel or exercise.
- **Elevation**: Elevate limb when at rest.

### Grade 2 (Moderate)
- **Complete Decompressive Therapy (CDT)**: Referral to certified lymphedema therapist.
  - **Manual Lymphatic Drainage (MLD)**: Specialized massage to redirect fluid.
  - **Compression Bandaging**: Multi-layer short-stretch bandages.
  - **Remedial Exercises**: Performed with compression to enhance pump mechanism.
- **Skin Care**: Aggressive hygiene to prevent cellulitis.

### Grade 3 (Severe)
- **Intensive CDT**: Daily MLD and bandaging.
- **Pneumatic Compression**: Consider advanced pneumatic compression devices (lymphedema pumps) for home use.
- **Surgical Evaluation**: Lymphatic bypass or transfer if refractory to conservative therapy.

## Red Flags & Critical Alerts

| Sign/Symptom | Potential Etiology | Action |
|--------------|--------------------|--------|
| **Acute painful swelling + Erythema + Warmth** | **Cellulitis** (Medical Emergency) | **URGENT**: Start antibiotics immediately. Rule out DVT. |
| **Unilateral swelling + Pain + Dilated veins** | **Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)** | **URGENT**: Doppler ultrasound. Differentiate from lymphedema (DVT is usually painful/acute; lymphedema is painless/chronic). |
| **Rapid progression of swelling** | **Recurrent Malignancy** | **Clinical Review**: Assess for tumor compression of lymphatics. |

## Patient Education & Prevention

**Lymphedema prevention is lifelong.**

### Limb Protection (The "Do Nots")
- **NO** blood pressure cuffs on the affected limb.
- **NO** needle sticks, blood draws, or IVs on the affected limb.
- **NO** tight jewelry, watches, or constrictive clothing.
- **NO** extreme temperatures (hot tubs, saunas, ice packs directly on skin).

### Skin Care & Injury Prevention
- **Hygiene**: Keep skin clean and dry. Use low-pH moisturizers.
- **Trauma**: Wear gloves for gardening/housework. Treat cuts/scratches immediately with antibiotic ointment.
- **Sun Protection**: Avoid sunburn; use high SPF sunscreen.
- **Insect Bites**: Use repellent; avoid areas with high insect activity.

## Comorbidity Considerations

### Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)
- **Differentiation**: DVT is acute, painful, often with prominent superficial veins. Lymphedema is chronic, usually painless, with skin thickening.
- **Management**: If DVT confirmed, anticoagulation is priority. Compression may be contraindicated in acute DVT phase.

### Congestive Heart Failure (CHF)
- **Differentiation**: CHF edema is typically bilateral and pitting. Lymphedema is usually unilateral (unless bilateral node dissection).
- **Management**: **CAUTION** with Manual Lymphatic Drainage (MLD) in uncompensated CHF; mobilizing fluid can precipitate pulmonary edema. Ensure CHF is stable before starting CDT.
