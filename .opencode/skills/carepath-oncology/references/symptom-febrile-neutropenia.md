# Febrile Neutropenia - Oncology Symptom Pathway

## Objective
Detect and manage febrile neutropenia early to prevent sepsis and mortality in immunocompromised cancer patients. This is a **medical emergency**.

## Duration
**Acute Phase**: 24-72 hours (until afebrile >24h and infection controlled)

---

## Eligibility Criteria

### Inclusion
- Cancer patients on **active chemotherapy** or recent chemotherapy (within 2-4 weeks)
- Patients with known or suspected **immunosuppression**
- Presentation of fever (single temp ≥38.3°C or ≥38.0°C sustained for >1 hr)

### Exclusion Criteria
- Non-neutropenic fever (ANC >1000/μL) - refer to general infection protocols
- Patient already hospitalized (this protocol is for outpatient/home monitoring detection)

---

## Primary Outcome Measures

| Outcome | Timeframe | Target |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| **Time to Antibiotics** | From fever detection | <60 minutes (Golden Hour) |
| **Fever Resolution** | Acute phase | Afebrile >24 hours |
| **Survival** | 30 days | 100% survival of FN episode |
| **Sepsis Prevention** | Acute phase | Prevent progression to septic shock |

---

## Devices & Monitoring Equipment

See **[Devices Reference](../../shared/devices.md)** for detailed specifications.

### Required Devices
- **Digital Thermometer**
  - **Critical**: Continuous or high-frequency monitoring required
- **Pulse Oximeter**
  - Monitor for hypoxemia associated with pneumonia/sepsis
- **Blood Pressure Monitor**
  - Monitor for hypotension (septic shock sign)

---

## Daily Monitoring Protocol

### Clinical Team Reviews (Daily)
1.  **Physiologic Data Review**
    - Temperature trends (fever curve)
    - Hemodynamic stability (BP, HR)
    - Oxygen saturation

2.  **Subjective Patient Data Review**
    - **Daily Symptom Diary**: See **[Oncology Questionnaire](../../shared/questionnaires/oncology-questionnaire.md)**
    - Chills/rigors
    - Localizing signs of infection (cough, dysuria, catheter site pain, diarrhea)

3.  **Patient Task Compliance Review**
    - Temperature checks Q4H (minimum)
    - Antibiotic adherence (if oral outpatient treatment)

---

## Alert Thresholds & Escalations

See **[Universal Alert Thresholds](../../shared/alert-thresholds.md)** for complete threshold table.

### Febrile Neutropenia Critical Alerts (CTCAE Grade 4)

| Parameter | Threshold | Clinical Significance | Action |
|-----------|-----------|-----------------------|--------|
| **Temperature** | ≥38.3°C (single) OR ≥38.0°C (>1 hr) | **FEBRILE NEUTROPENIA** | **IMMEDIATE EMERGENCY**: ED Referral + Notify Oncologist |
| **ANC** | <500/μL (or expected drop <500) | Severe Neutropenia | High risk for overwhelming sepsis |
| **Systolic BP** | <90 mmHg | Septic Shock | **Call 911 / Emergency Transport** |
| **Mental Status** | Confusion / Altered | CNS hypoperfusion/infection | **Call 911 / Emergency Transport** |

### Action Protocol for Fever + Neutropenia
1.  **IMMEDIATE** referral to Emergency Department or Acute Assessment Unit.
2.  **Blood Cultures** x2 sets (peripheral + central line) BEFORE antibiotics.
3.  **Empiric Antibiotics** administered within **60 minutes** of presentation.

---

## Care Coordination

### Emergency Response
- **ED/Hospital Admission**: Required for most high-risk patients (MASCC score <21).
- **Infectious Disease Consult**: For fungal infections, resistant organisms, or persistent fever.

### Interdisciplinary Task Management
- **Oncology Team**: Adjust chemotherapy schedule, consider G-CSF.
- **Home Health**: IV antibiotic administration (if low-risk outpatient candidate).
- **Lab**: CBC with differential, CMP, Blood Cultures, Urinalysis.

---

## Treatment Protocol

### Immediate Management (The "Golden Hour")
1.  **Blood Cultures**: Obtain immediately.
2.  **Empiric Broad-Spectrum Antibiotics**:
    - **IV Monotherapy**: Cefepime, Piperacillin-tazobactam, or Meropenem.
    - **Dual Therapy** (if unstable): Add Aminoglycoside or Vancomycin (if MRSA risk).
    - **Oral** (Low risk only): Ciprofloxacin + Amoxicillin/Clavulanate.

### Supportive Care
- **Hydration**: IV fluids for hypotension/dehydration.
- **Antipyretics**: Acetaminophen (Paracetamol). **AVOID NSAIDs** if thrombocytopenic (platelets <50k).
- **G-CSF**: Consider Granulocyte-Colony Stimulating Factor (Filgrastim) for high-risk patients.

---

## Complications to Monitor

### Septic Shock
- Hypotension, tachycardia, organ dysfunction.
- **Action**: Aggressive resuscitation, ICU admission.

### Multi-Organ Failure
- Renal failure, respiratory failure, DIC.

### Breakthrough Infection
- Persistent fever despite antibiotics >3-5 days.
- Consider **Fungal Infection** (Candida, Aspergillus) -> Add antifungal.

---

## Comorbidity Management

See **[Comorbidity Matrix](../../shared/comorbidity-matrix.md)** for detailed guidance.

### Common Comorbidities
- **Diabetes**: Hyperglycemia risk with infection/stress/steroids. Monitor glucose closely.
- **Renal Impairment**: **Dose adjustment** required for antibiotics (e.g., Cefepime, Vancomycin).
- **Heart Failure**: Careful fluid resuscitation to avoid overload.

---

## Transition to Post-Acute Care

### Resolution Criteria
- ✅ Afebrile for >24 hours without antipyretics.
- ✅ ANC >500/μL and rising.
- ✅ Blood cultures negative (48h).
- ✅ Clinically stable.

### Handoff
- Resume chemotherapy only when ANC recovered (usually >1500).
- Re-evaluate need for prophylactic antibiotics/G-CSF for next cycle.
