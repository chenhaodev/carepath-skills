# Cancer Pain - Oncology Symptom Pathway

## Objective
Achieve effective pain control using the WHO Analgesic Ladder to improve quality of life and functional status.

## Duration
**Ongoing** (Chronic management with acute exacerbation protocols)

---

## Eligibility Criteria

### Inclusion
- Cancer patients experiencing pain related to disease or treatment.
- Patients with acute breakthrough pain or worsening chronic pain.

### Exclusion
- Pain clearly unrelated to cancer (e.g., acute trauma) - treat per standard trauma protocols but consider metastasis.

---

## Primary Outcome Measures

| Outcome | Timeframe | Target |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| **Pain Score Reduction** | Acute exacerbation | Reduction by ≥2 points or to <4/10 |
| **Functional Improvement** | Ongoing | Maintenance of ADLs |
| **Patient Satisfaction** | Ongoing | Satisfaction with pain management |

---

## Devices & Monitoring Equipment

See **[Devices Reference](../../shared/devices.md)** for detailed specifications.

### Required Tools
- **Pain Assessment Tools**:
  - Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) 0-10
  - Visual Analog Scale (VAS)
  - **Symptom Diary**: For tracking breakthrough pain and medication usage.

---

## Daily Monitoring Protocol

### Assessment Framework (NOPQRSTUV)
- **N**umber of pains (identify all sites)
- **O**rigin/Onset
- **P**alliating/Provoking factors
- **Q**uality (burning, throbbing, shooting)
- **R**adiation
- **S**everity (0-10)
- **T**iming/Treatment history
- **U**nderstanding (patient's perspective)
- **V**alues (impact on life)

### Clinical Team Reviews
- Review pain scores and trends.
- Monitor for medication side effects (constipation, sedation).
- Assess breakthrough medication usage frequency.

---

## Alert Thresholds & Escalations

See **[Universal Alert Thresholds](../../shared/alert-thresholds.md)** for complete threshold table.

### Pain Severity Grading (CTCAE)

| Grade | Severity | Description | Action |
|-------|----------|-------------|--------|
| **Grade 1** | Mild | Pain not interfering with function | Non-opioids, monitor |
| **Grade 2** | Moderate | Limiting instrumental ADL | Weak opioids, adjust dose |
| **Grade 3** | Severe | Limiting self-care ADL | **Strong opioids**, urgent review |
| **Grade 4** | Disabling | Life-threatening consequences | **Emergency evaluation** |

### Red Flags (Immediate Escalation)
- **New Neurological Deficits**: Back pain with weakness, sensory loss, or bowel/bladder dysfunction -> **Rule out Spinal Cord Compression (Emergency MRI)**.
- **Uncontrolled Pain**: Pain crisis despite rapid titration.
- **Opioid Toxicity**: Respiratory rate <10, pinpoint pupils, sedation.

---

## Care Coordination

- **Palliative Care Consult**: For complex pain, opioid rotation, or psychosocial distress.
- **Radiation Oncology**: For palliative radiation of bone metastases.
- **Interventional Pain**: For nerve blocks or intrathecal pumps.

---

## Treatment Protocol

### WHO Analgesic Ladder

1.  **Step 1 (Mild Pain - NRS 1-3)**
    - **Non-Opioids**: Acetaminophen (Paracetamol), NSAIDs.
    - *Caution*: Check platelets before NSAIDs (avoid if <50k). Avoid NSAIDs in renal failure.

2.  **Step 2 (Moderate Pain - NRS 4-6)**
    - **Weak Opioids**: Codeine, Tramadol, Dihydrocodeine.
    - +/- Non-opioids and Adjuvants.

3.  **Step 3 (Severe Pain - NRS 7-10)**
    - **Strong Opioids**: Morphine, Oxycodone, Fentanyl, Hydromorphone.
    - Titrate to effect.
    - +/- Non-opioids and Adjuvants.

### Adjuvant Analgesics
- **Neuropathic Pain**: Gabapentin, Pregabalin, Amitriptyline, Duloxetine.
- **Bone Pain**: Bisphosphonates, Corticosteroids.
- **Visceral Pain**: Anticholinergics, Corticosteroids.

---

## Complications to Monitor

### Opioid Side Effects
- **Constipation**: **MANDATORY** prophylactic bowel regimen (Senna + Docusate/Polyethylene Glycol) with all opioids.
- **Nausea/Vomiting**: Antiemetics (Metoclopramide, Ondansetron).
- **Sedation/Respiratory Depression**: Monitor RR and sedation score. Naloxone available for emergency.

### Disease Progression
- Worsening pain may indicate tumor growth or new metastases.

---

## Comorbidity Management

See **[Comorbidity Matrix](../../shared/comorbidity-matrix.md)** for detailed guidance.

- **Renal Failure**: Avoid NSAIDs. Use Fentanyl or Methadone (safer than Morphine). Reduce doses.
- **Hepatic Failure**: Use lower doses, extend intervals. Avoid Acetaminophen >2g/day.
- **Elderly**: "Start low, go slow". Higher risk of delirium/falls.

---

## Transition to Post-Acute Care

### Stability Criteria
- ✅ Pain controlled to patient's acceptable level (usually <4/10).
- ✅ Stable analgesic regimen for >24-48 hours.
- ✅ Side effects managed (bowels moving).
- ✅ Patient/caregiver educated on medication administration.
