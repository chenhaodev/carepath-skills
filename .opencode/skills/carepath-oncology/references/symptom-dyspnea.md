# Dyspnea (Breathing Problems) - Oncology Symptom Pathway

## Objective
Identify and manage respiratory distress in cancer patients, distinguishing between reversible causes and terminal progression.

## Duration
**Acute Phase**: Immediate assessment and stabilization.

---

## Eligibility Criteria

### Inclusion
- Cancer patients presenting with new or worsening shortness of breath.
- Patients with known lung metastases, pleural effusion, or primary lung cancer.

### Exclusion
- Respiratory arrest (Code Blue) -> Immediate ACLS.

---

## Primary Outcome Measures

| Outcome | Timeframe | Target |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| **Oxygen Saturation** | Immediate | SpO2 >90-92% (or patient baseline) |
| **Symptom Relief** | Acute | Reduction in work of breathing / air hunger |
| **Cause Identification** | 24-48 hours | Diagnose treatable causes (PE, effusion, etc.) |

## Devices & Monitoring Equipment

See **[Devices Reference](../../shared/devices.md)** for detailed specifications.

### Required Devices
- **Pulse Oximeter**: Continuous or frequent spot checks.
- **Stethoscope**: Lung auscultation.

---

## Daily Monitoring Protocol

### Assessment Parameters
- **Respiratory Rate**: Trend is sensitive for deterioration.
- **SpO2**: Resting and exertional.
- **Work of Breathing**: Accessory muscle use, ability to speak in full sentences.
- **Lung Sounds**: Wheeze, crackles, diminished breath sounds.

### Symptom Diary
- See **[Oncology Questionnaire](../../shared/questionnaires/oncology-questionnaire.md)**.
- Assess intensity (0-10), triggers, and relief measures.

## Alert Thresholds & Escalations

See **[Universal Alert Thresholds](../../shared/alert-thresholds.md)** for complete threshold table.

### Dyspnea Severity Grading (CTCAE)

| Grade | Severity | Description | Action |
|-------|----------|-------------|--------|
| **Grade 1** | Mild | SOB on exertion | Outpatient management |
| **Grade 2** | Moderate | SOB with minimal exertion | Medical review, consider imaging |
| **Grade 3** | Severe | SOB at rest | **Urgent Hospitalization/Oxygen** |
| **Grade 4** | Life-Threatening | Urgent intervention indicated | **Emergency / ICU** |

### Red Flags (EMERGENCY)
- **SpO2 ≤94%** (new drop).
- **Stridor**: Upper airway obstruction (tumor mass effect) -> **Immediate ENT/Anesthesia**.
- **Chest Pain**: Rule out PE / MI.
- **Haemoptysis**: Massive >100ml -> Airway emergency.
- **SVC Syndrome**: Facial swelling, distended neck veins -> Urgent Radiation/Stent.

---

## Care Coordination

- **Respiratory Therapy**: Oxygen delivery, nebulizers.
- **Interventional Pulmonology/Radiology**: Thoracentesis for pleural effusion.
- **Radiation Oncology**: For airway obstruction or SVC syndrome.

---

## Treatment Protocol

### General Measures
- **Positioning**: Upright, leaning forward.
- **Fan Therapy**: Airflow across face (stimulates trigeminal nerve to reduce breathlessness).
- **Oxygen**: Titrate to SpO2 >90-92%. Use Nasal Cannula -> Venturi Mask -> Non-Rebreather.

### Pharmacologic Management
- **Opioids**: Morphine (low dose) reduces air hunger.
  - *Naive*: Morphine 2.5-5mg PO or 1-2mg SC/IV q4h.
- **Benzodiazepines**: Lorazepam 0.5-1mg for anxiety-associated dyspnea.
- **Corticosteroids**: Dexamethasone for lymphangitis carcinomatosa, radiation pneumonitis, or airway obstruction.
- **Bronchodilators**: Albuterol/Ipratropium if wheezing/COPD component.

### Cause-Specific Management
- **Pleural Effusion**: Thoracentesis / PleurX catheter.
- **Pulmonary Embolism**: Anticoagulation (LMWH).
- **Pneumonia**: Antibiotics.
- **Anemia**: Transfusion if symptomatic and Hb <7-8.

---

## Complications to Monitor

- **Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure**: Requiring High-Flow Nasal Cannula or NIV.
- **Hypercapnic Respiratory Failure**: CO2 retention (drowsiness, confusion).
- **Aspiration Pneumonia**: Especially in patients with dysphagia/head & neck cancer.

---

## Comorbidity Management

See **[Comorbidity Matrix](../../shared/comorbidity-matrix.md)** for detailed guidance.

- **COPD**: Target SpO2 88-92% to avoid CO2 retention. Use bronchodilators.
- **CHF**: Diuretics for fluid overload. Differentiate from lymphangitis.

---

## Transition to Post-Acute Care

### Stability Criteria
- ✅ SpO2 stable on room air or stable home oxygen baseline.
- ✅ Reversible causes treated (e.g., effusion drained, PE anticoagulated).
- ✅ Symptoms manageable with oral meds.
