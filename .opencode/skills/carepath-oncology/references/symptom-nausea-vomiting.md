# Nausea and Vomiting - Oncology Symptom Pathway

## Objective
Prevent dehydration, malnutrition, and treatment delays caused by chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) or radiation-induced nausea and vomiting (RINV) through proactive assessment and graded intervention.

## Duration
**Throughout active treatment** (Acute phase: 0-24 hrs post-treatment; Delayed phase: 2-5 days post-treatment)

---

## Eligibility Criteria

### Inclusion
- Patients receiving **emetogenic chemotherapy** or **radiation therapy**
- Patients reporting nausea and/or vomiting related to cancer treatment
- Able to tolerate oral medications (for Grade 1-2)

### Exclusion Criteria
- **Bowel obstruction** (requires surgical/GI evaluation)
- **Brain metastasis** with increased ICP (requires specific management)
- **Anticipatory nausea** (primary psychological/behavioral management)
- **Vestibular causes** (vertigo/dizziness predominant)

---

## Primary Outcome Measures

| Outcome | Timeframe | Target |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| **Symptom Control** | Daily | CTCAE Grade <2 (able to eat/drink) |
| **Hydration Status** | Daily | No clinical signs of dehydration |
| **Weight Stability** | Weekly | <5% weight loss from baseline |
| **Unplanned Utilization** | 30 days | Minimize ED visits for dehydration |

---

## Devices & Monitoring Equipment

See **[Devices Reference](../../shared/devices.md)** for detailed specifications.

### Required Devices
- **Connected Weight Scale**
  - Monitor for rapid weight loss (dehydration) or long-term loss (malnutrition)
- **Thermometer**
  - Monitor for fever (infection risk with neutropenia)

### Optional Devices
- **Connected BP Cuff**
  - Monitor for hypotension (sign of severe dehydration)

---

## Daily Monitoring Protocol

### Clinical Team Reviews (Daily)
1. **Physiologic Data Review**
   - Weight trend (rapid drop = fluid loss)
   - Vital signs (if available): Tachycardia/hypotension suggesting volume depletion

2. **Subjective Patient Data Review**
   - **Nausea Severity**: 0-10 scale or CTCAE grading
   - **Vomiting Frequency**: Number of episodes in past 24 hours
   - **Oral Intake**: Estimated fluid/food intake (% of normal)
   - **Urine Output**: Frequency and color

3. **Patient Task Compliance Review**
   - Anti-emetic medication adherence (prophylactic vs breakthrough)
   - Fluid intake goals met?

## Alert Thresholds & Escalations

See **[Universal Alert Thresholds](../../shared/alert-thresholds.md)** for complete threshold table.

### CTCAE Grading (v5.0) - Nausea & Vomiting

| Grade | Description | Clinical Significance | Action |
|-------|-------------|-----------------------|--------|
| **Grade 1** | Loss of appetite without alteration in eating habits | Mild | **Advisory**: Dietary modification, ensure prophylactic meds taken |
| **Grade 2** | Oral intake decreased without significant weight loss, dehydration or malnutrition | Moderate | **Urgent**: Initiate/escalate breakthrough antiemetics, push fluids |
| **Grade 3** | Inadequate oral intake; IV fluids, tube feedings, or TPN indicated | Severe | **Critical**: **Hospitalization/Clinic visit** for IV fluids & IV antiemetics |
| **Grade 4** | Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated | Life-Threatening | **Emergency**: Immediate ED transfer |

### Symptom-Specific Red Flags
- **Signs of Dehydration**: Tachycardia (>100 bpm), hypotension (SBP <90), dizziness, decreased urine output
- **Electrolyte Imbalance**: Muscle cramps, confusion, irregular heartbeat
- **Weight Loss**: >5% of body weight
- **Hematemesis**: "Coffee ground" emesis or bright red blood (Mallory-Weiss tear risk)

---

## Care Coordination

### Telemedicine/Virtual Visits
- **Daily check-ins** for Grade 2 symptoms until resolved to Grade 1
- **Ad-hoc visits** for medication adjustment (switching antiemetics)

### Interdisciplinary Task Management
- **IV Hydration**: Coordination with infusion center or home infusion for Grade 3 prevention
- **Nutrition**: Dietitian consult for small, frequent meals/dietary modification
- **Pharmacy**: Management of antiemetic prescriptions and interactions

---

## Treatment Protocol

### Prophylactic Strategy (Based on Emetogenic Risk)
- **High Risk**: 5-HT3 antagonist + NK1 antagonist + Dexamethasone + Olanzapine
- **Moderate Risk**: 5-HT3 antagonist + Dexamethasone
- **Low Risk**: Dexamethasone or 5-HT3 antagonist alone

### Breakthrough Management (Stepwise)
1. **First Line**: Metoclopramide 10-20mg PO q6h OR Prochlorperazine 10mg PO q6h
2. **Second Line**: Add/Switch to Olanzapine 5-10mg PO daily (if not already on)
3. **Refractory**: Consider Lorazepam (anxiety component), Cannabinoids (Dronabinol), or Scopolamine patch

### Non-Pharmacologic Interventions
- Small, frequent meals (BRAT diet: Bananas, Rice, Applesauce, Toast)
- Ginger products (tea, candies)
- Acupressure (P6 point)
- Avoid strong odors, spicy/fatty foods

---

## Complications to Monitor

### Dehydration / AKI
- Monitor BUN/Cr if available
- Assess mucous membranes, skin turgor
- **Action**: Aggressive oral hydration or IV fluids

### Electrolyte Abnormalities
- Hypokalemia, Hyponatremia, Hypomagnesemia from vomiting
- **Action**: Replete electrolytes, monitor ECG if severe

### Aspiration Pneumonia
- Risk in sedated/debilitated patients
- **Action**: Elevate head of bed, ensure alertness before oral intake

---

## Comorbidity Considerations

See **[Comorbidity Matrix](../../shared/comorbidity-matrix.md)** for detailed guidance.

- **Diabetes**: Dexamethasone causes hyperglycemia. Monitor glucose closely; may need insulin adjustment.
- **Renal Failure**: Dose adjust Metoclopramide/NK1 antagonists. Avoid magnesium-containing antacids.
- **QT Prolongation**: Caution with 5-HT3 antagonists (Ondansetron) and antipsychotics (Olanzapine/Haloperidol). Monitor ECG.
- **Parkinson's Disease**: Avoid Metoclopramide/Prochlorperazine (dopamine antagonists). Use 5-HT3 antagonists.
