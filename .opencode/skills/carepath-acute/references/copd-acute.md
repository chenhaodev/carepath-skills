## Devices & Monitoring Equipment

See **[Devices Reference](../../shared/devices.md)** for complete specifications.

### Required Devices
- **Everion Armband*** (or alternative continuous monitor)
  - Continuous HR, RR, SpO2, skin temperature, activity levels
  - Critical for detecting early desaturation
- **Connected BP Cuff**
  - Welch Allyn 1700 OR Omron BP7000
  - Monitor for steroid-induced hypertension
- **Connected Pulse Oximeter** (Nonin 3230)
  - If NOT using Everion armband
  - Spot-check measurements
- **Oral Thermometer**
  - If NOT using Everion (which provides skin temp)
  - Monitor for infection/fever

*Optional based on severity and clinician preference per SOP

---

## Daily Monitoring Protocol

### Clinical Team Reviews (Daily)
1. **Physiologic Data Review**
   - **SpO2 trends**: Most critical COPD parameter
     - Target: Maintain at patient's baseline (often 88-92% for COPD)
   - **Respiratory Rate**: Elevated RR indicates respiratory distress
   - **Heart Rate**: Tachycardia common in exacerbations
   - **Temperature**: Fever suggests bacterial infection

2. **Subjective Patient Data Review**
   - **Daily COPD Symptom Checker**: See **[COPD Questionnaire](../../shared/questionnaires/copd-questionnaire.md)**
     - Dyspnea changes (Anthonisen criteria)
     - Sputum volume increase
     - Sputum purulence (color change to yellow/green)
     - Cough frequency
     - Wheezing
     - Medication adherence (maintenance and rescue inhalers)

3. **Patient Task Compliance**
   - Daily maintenance inhaler use?
   - Rescue inhaler frequency (increasing use = worsening)
   - Steroid course compliance (if prescribed)
   - Antibiotic adherence (if prescribed)

## Alert Thresholds & Escalations

See **[Universal Alert Thresholds](../../shared/alert-thresholds.md)** for complete table.

### COPD-Specific Critical Alerts

| Parameter | Threshold | Clinical Significance | Action |
|-----------|-----------|----------------------|--------|
| **SpO2** | <92% (or below patient's baseline) | Respiratory failure, exacerbation worsening | **Urgent**: Increase O2, assess for hospital transfer, consider steroids/bronchodilators |
| **Respiration Rate** | >24 breaths/min | Respiratory distress | **Same-day evaluation**: Assess work of breathing, consider nebulizers, steroids |
| **Heart Rate** | >120 bpm | Respiratory distress, hypoxia, beta-agonist effect | Evaluate cause, optimize bronchodilator therapy |
| **Temperature** | >38.5°C | Bacterial infection requiring antibiotics | **Same-day**: Consider antibiotics (if not already on), blood cultures if sepsis concern |
| **Biovitals Index** | >0.7 | Composite risk score - deterioration | **Clinical review within 4 hours** |

### Symptom-Based Alerts
- **Purulent sputum** (yellow/green): Bacterial infection - consider antibiotics (Anthonisen criteria)
- **Extreme dyspnea** at rest: Respiratory failure - **EMERGENT evaluation**
- **Increasing rescue inhaler use** without improvement: Inadequate treatment
- **Non-adherence** to maintenance inhaler: Education/barrier assessment needed

---

## Care Coordination

### Telemedicine/Virtual Visits
- **Daily check-ins** during first 48 hours (high-risk period)
- **Every 2 days** thereafter if improving
- **Ad-hoc visits** for medication adjustments, breathing technique education

### Interdisciplinary Task Management
- **Phlebotomy**: Home blood draws (CBC, CRP) if infection suspected
- **Radiology**: Portable chest X-ray if pneumonia concern
- **Nebulizer Administration**: RN visits for nebulized bronchodilators/steroids (if patient unable to self-administer)
- **Steroid and Antibiotic Administration**: Ensure patient has prescriptions filled, can self-administer

---

## Treatment Protocol

### Pharmacologic Management

#### Bronchodilators
- **Short-acting beta-agonists (SABA)**: Albuterol nebulizer or MDI q4-6hrs PRN
- **Short-acting anticholinergics (SAMA)**: Ipratropium nebulizer q6hrs
- **Combination**: Albuterol + ipratropium (DuoNeb) most effective for acute exacerbations

#### Corticosteroids
- **Prednisone 40mg PO daily** x 5 days (standard course)
  - Alternative: Methylprednisolone 32-40mg PO daily
- **Monitor**: Hyperglycemia (if diabetic), BP elevation, GI upset
- **Patient education**: Take with food, complete full course even if feeling better

#### Antibiotics (if indicated)
**Anthonisen Criteria** - Antibiotics indicated if 2+ of:
1. Increased dyspnea
2. Increased sputum volume
3. Increased sputum purulence

**Choices**:
- Azithromycin 500mg day 1, then 250mg x4 days, OR
- Doxycycline 100mg BID x 5-7 days, OR
- Amoxicillin-clavulanate 875mg BID x 5-7 days

#### Oxygen Therapy
- **Goal**: Maintain SpO2 at patient's baseline (typically 88-92%)
- **Caution**: Avoid excessive O2 (risk of CO2 retention in COPD)
- **Titrate**: Start low (1-2L NC), adjust to target

### Non-Pharmacologic Management
- **Pulmonary rehabilitation**: Breathing exercises, pursed-lip breathing
- **Smoking cessation**: If active smoker, initiate cessation plan
- **Nutrition**: Adequate caloric intake (respiratory effort increases metabolic demand)

---

## Complications to Monitor

### Respiratory Failure
- **Hypoxemic**: SpO2 <88% despite O2 therapy
- **Hypercapnic**: CO2 retention (drowsiness, confusion, headache)
- **Action**: Hospital transfer for BiPAP or intubation

### Pneumonia (Superinfection)
- New infiltrate on chest X-ray
- Persistent fever despite antibiotics
- **Action**: Broaden antibiotic coverage, consider hospitalization

### Pneumothorax
- Sudden worsening dyspnea + chest pain
- Absent breath sounds on one side
- **Action**: **EMERGENT** - chest X-ray, hospital transfer, chest tube

### Cardiac Complications
- **Acute CHF**: COPD + CHF common comorbidity, exacerbation can trigger CHF decompensation
- **Arrhythmias**: Hypoxia, beta-agonists, steroids can all provoke arrhythmias
- **Pulmonary hypertension**: Worsening with exacerbation

---

## Comorbidity Management

See **[Comorbidity Matrix](../../shared/comorbidity-matrix.md)** for detailed guidance.

### Common COPD Comorbidities
- **COPD + CHF**: Dyspnea from both - look for crackles (CHF) vs wheezes (COPD), weight gain (CHF)
- **COPD + Diabetes**: Steroids worsen glucose - increase monitoring to Q4-6hrs during steroid course
- **COPD + HTN**: Steroids and beta-agonists increase BP - monitor closely
- **COPD + Pneumonia**: Often coexist - treat both (antibiotics + bronchodilators + steroids)

---

## Transition to Post-Acute Care

### Discharge Readiness Criteria
- ✅ SpO2 stable or returning to baseline on ≤4L O2 (or patient's home O2 requirement)
- ✅ Respiratory rate <24, work of breathing improved
- ✅ Transitioned to oral medications (steroids, antibiotics if needed)
- ✅ Rescue inhaler use decreasing
- ✅ Able to perform ADLs without severe dyspnea
- ✅ Patient can manage inhalers independently
- ✅ No fever x24 hours (if infection was present)

### Handoff to Post-Acute
See **[Transition to Post-Acute](./transition-to-postacute.md)** for full protocol.

**Key Handoff Information**:
- Baseline SpO2 and O2 requirements
- Steroid taper plan (if extended course)
- Antibiotic completion date
- Inhaler regimen (maintenance + rescue)
- CAT score baseline for post-acute trending
- Pulmonary rehab referral status
