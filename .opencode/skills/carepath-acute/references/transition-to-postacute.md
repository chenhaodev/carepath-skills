# Transition from Acute Care to Post-Acute Care

## Overview

This protocol defines the criteria, process, and handoff procedures for transitioning patients from the **Acute Care Pathway** (hospital-at-home with IV therapy) to the **Post-Acute Care Pathway** (readmission prevention with oral therapy).

**Key Principle**: Transition occurs when patient no longer requires IV medications or intensive monitoring, but still needs structured home monitoring to prevent readmission.

---

## Universal Transition Criteria

**ALL of the following must be met** (applies to all 7 disease pathways):

### 1. Clinical Stability

- **Vital signs normalizing**: No critical alerts in past 24-48 hours
- **Acute symptoms resolving**: Primary complaint (dyspnea, fever, pain, etc.) improving or resolved
- **Complication-free**: No active complications requiring acute-level intervention

### 2. Medication Transition Complete

- **IV therapy discontinued**: All IV medications successfully converted to oral equivalents OR completed course
- **Medication reconciliation**: Updated medication list reviewed with patient, discrepancies resolved
- **Adequate oral tolerance**: Patient able to take oral medications (not vomiting, adequate GI absorption)

### 3. Functional Status

- **Safe for lower-intensity monitoring**: Patient/caregivers able to perform daily tasks (questionnaires, vital checks) with less frequent care team contact
- **Device proficiency**: Patient/caregivers trained on and able to use home monitoring devices
- **Home environment safe**: Adequate caregiver support if needed, no major safety concerns

### 4. Clinical Team Agreement

- **Physician approval**: Attending physician confirms patient meets transition criteria
- **Care team consensus**: Nursing, pharmacy, care coordination agree patient ready for step-down

---

## Transition Process (Step-by-Step)

### Step 1: Transition Assessment (24-48 hours before planned discharge)

**Care team reviews**:
1. Disease-specific transition criteria checklist (above)
2. Universal transition criteria (clinical stability, medication transition, functional status)
3. Medication reconciliation (IV → oral conversions documented)
4. Patient/caregiver device proficiency assessment
5. Home safety evaluation (adequate support, no barriers to care)

**Decision**: Ready for transition (proceed to Step 2) OR Not ready (continue acute care, reassess in 24 hours)

---

### Step 2: Medication Reconciliation & Prescriptions

**Pharmacist or physician completes**:

1. **Updated medication list**:
   - Discontinued medications (IV formulations)
   - New medications (oral conversions, new additions)
   - Continued medications (unchanged from pre-acute)
   - Dose changes (e.g., diuretic increased, insulin adjusted)

2. **Prescription orders**:
   - All oral medications prescribed with adequate supply (30-90 day supply)
   - Device supplies ordered (test strips, lancets, etc.)
   - DME ordered if needed (oxygen, nebulizer, etc.)

3. **Patient education**:
   - Medication purposes reviewed
   - Side effects to watch for
   - Adherence importance emphasized
   - Pharmacy pickup/delivery arranged

---

### Step 3: Device Transition & Training

**Device coordinator or nurse completes**:

1. **Discontinue acute care devices** (if applicable):
   - VitalPatch removed (if used - 5-day disposable)
   - Intensive monitoring equipment collected

2. **Deploy post-acute devices** (if not already in use):
   - Everion armband fitted and activated
   - Weight scale, BP cuff, pulse ox, glucometer, etc. verified working
   - Batteries charged, connectivity tested

3. **Patient/caregiver training** (verify proficiency):
   - Device usage demonstrated
   - Data transmission tested (patient performs task, care team sees data)
   - Troubleshooting reviewed (who to call if device malfunctions)

4. **Backup plan established**:
   - Manual logging instructions if device fails
   - Replacement device available if needed

---

### Step 4: Alert Threshold Adjustment

**Clinical team configures**:

1. **Review disease-specific post-acute thresholds**:
   - Reference [`shared/alert-thresholds.md`](../../shared/alert-thresholds.md)
   - Adjust for patient's baseline (e.g., COPD patient may have lower SpO2 baseline)

2. **Update alert settings in monitoring platform**:
   - Critical alerts (immediate response)
   - Urgent alerts (24-hour response)
   - Advisory alerts (2-3 day response)

3. **Threshold differences acute → post-acute**:
   - **Acute care**: Tighter thresholds, faster response times (minutes to hours)
   - **Post-acute care**: Allow more patient self-management time, response times in hours to days
   - **Example (CHF weight)**:
     - Acute: Alert if weight gain ≥2 lbs/day → Immediate diuretic adjustment
     - Post-acute: Alert if weight gain ≥3 lbs/3 days → Phone call same day, video visit if continues

4. **Patient notification settings**:
   - Patient receives push notifications for critical alerts (e.g., glucose <70 mg/dL)
   - Care team receives all alerts, triages urgency

---

### Step 5: Care Team Handoff

**Acute care team → Post-acute care team**:

1. **Handoff note includes**:
   - **Primary diagnosis**: Reason for acute care admission
   - **Acute care summary**:
     - Duration (X days)
     - Treatments given (IV diuretics, IV antibiotics, IV insulin, etc.)
     - Complications encountered (if any)
     - Peak severity (worst vital signs, lab values)
   - **Current status**:
     - Vital signs at transition
     - Most recent labs (electrolytes, Cr, BUN, glucose, INR, etc.)
     - Weight (if CHF), SpO2 (if respiratory), BP (if HTN)
   - **Medication changes**:
     - IV → oral conversions documented
     - New medications added
     - Dose adjustments made
   - **Comorbidities**: Other chronic diseases requiring monitoring
   - **Transition plan**:
     - Post-acute monitoring duration (30/90/14 days)
     - Key parameters to monitor (weight, BP, glucose, INR, etc.)
     - Anticipated challenges (medication adherence, social factors, etc.)

2. **Post-acute care team acknowledges**:
   - Confirms receipt of handoff note
   - Reviews patient data in monitoring platform
   - Identifies high-risk factors (frequent re-admissions, multiple comorbidities, non-adherence history)

3. **Continuity maintained**:
   - Patient phone number, emergency contact verified
   - Next scheduled video visit booked (typically within 3-5 days of transition)
   - Patient informed of care team change (if different personnel)

---

### Step 6: Patient & Caregiver Education

**Nurse or care coordinator reviews with patient**:

1. **Transition explanation**:
   - "You're doing much better and no longer need IV medications"
   - "We'll continue monitoring you at home for [30/90/14] more days to prevent readmission"
   - "Your daily tasks are the same, but our care team will check in less frequently (every 2-3 days instead of daily)"

2. **Daily task responsibilities**:
   - Review post-acute pathway daily tasks (questionnaires, vitals, medication logging)
   - Emphasize adherence importance ("These daily weights are the #1 way we prevent you from going back to the hospital")

3. **When to contact care team**:
   - Review disease-specific warning signs (weight gain, worsening dyspnea, fever, etc.)
   - 24/7 nurse hotline number provided
   - When to call 911 (emergency symptoms reviewed)

4. **Medication adherence**:
   - Review all medications, purposes, dosing schedule
   - Pill organizer recommended (if multiple medications)
   - Refill plan established (auto-refill, pharmacy delivery, etc.)

5. **Follow-up appointments**:
   - PCP appointment scheduled (within 7-14 days)
   - Specialist appointment scheduled if needed (cardiology for CHF, pulmonology for COPD, etc.)
   - Lab work ordered if needed (INR for warfarin, electrolytes for diuretics, etc.)

---

### Step 7: Monitoring Intensity Adjustment

**Post-acute monitoring schedule** (differs from acute care):

| Aspect | Acute Care | Post-Acute Care |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Patient daily tasks** | Same | Same (questionnaires, vitals, medication logging) |
| **Care team review frequency** | Daily (minimum) | Every 2-3 days (routine), or when alerts trigger |
| **Video visit frequency** | 2-3x per week | Weekly (first 2 weeks), then biweekly |
| **Alert response time** | Critical: <5 min<br>Urgent: <1 hr<br>Advisory: <4 hrs | Critical: <1 hr<br>Urgent: <24 hrs<br>Advisory: <2-3 days |
| **Lab monitoring** | Frequent (daily for diuretics, q1hr glucose for IV insulin) | Less frequent (weekly INR, QID glucose) |

**Rationale for lower intensity**:
- Patient stabilized, lower risk of acute decompensation
- Focus shifts from acute treatment to readmission prevention
- Patient self-management emphasized (with safety net of remote monitoring)

---

### Step 8: Documentation & Billing

**Required documentation**:

1. **Transition note** (physician or NP/PA):
   - Acute care completion criteria met ✓
   - IV therapy discontinued ✓
   - Medication reconciliation completed ✓
   - Patient stable for post-acute care ✓
   - Post-acute monitoring plan outlined

2. **Billing codes updated**:
   - Acute care episode closed (hospital-at-home billing)
   - Post-acute care episode opened (RPM - remote patient monitoring billing codes)
   - Device billing codes updated (VitalPatch → Everion armband, etc.)

3. **Quality metrics tracking**:
   - Acute care length of stay (2-10 days)
   - Successful transition (no readmission within 7 days of transition)
   - 30-day readmission tracking (begins from acute care completion)

---

## Special Transition Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Patient Deteriorates Before Transition

**Situation**: Patient met transition criteria yesterday, but this morning has worsening symptoms (e.g., CHF patient gained 3 lbs overnight, increased dyspnea).

**Action**:
1. **HALT transition** - Patient not ready for step-down
2. Resume intensive acute care monitoring
3. Escalate treatment (increase IV diuretics, add medications, etc.)
4. Reassess transition criteria in 24-48 hours
5. Investigate cause of deterioration (medication non-adherence, dietary indiscretion, new infection, etc.)

**Documentation**: Document why transition delayed, interventions taken

---

### Scenario 2: Early Post-Acute Readmission (Within 7 Days)

**Situation**: Patient transitioned to post-acute care 3 days ago, now requires re-admission to acute care (e.g., COPD patient develops exacerbation).

**Action**:
1. **Re-enter acute care pathway** - Treat as new acute episode
2. Review handoff note - Did acute care team miss something? Was transition premature?
3. Root cause analysis:
   - Premature transition (should have continued acute care longer)?
   - New acute event (unrelated to initial illness)?
   - Medication non-adherence post-transition?
   - Social factors (patient couldn't manage at lower monitoring intensity)?
4. Document lessons learned - Inform future transition decisions

**Quality metric impact**: Early readmission (<7 days) flags potential premature transition - quality improvement opportunity

---

### Scenario 3: Patient Refuses Post-Acute Monitoring

**Situation**: Patient completes acute care, meets transition criteria, but declines post-acute monitoring ("I feel fine, don't need more monitoring").

**Action**:
1. **Patient education**: Explain readmission risk (e.g., "25% of CHF patients readmitted within 30 days without monitoring, vs 15% with monitoring")
2. **Address barriers**: Why refusing? (Device burden, privacy concerns, cost, lack of understanding?)
3. **Compromise options**:
   - Reduced monitoring (daily tasks only, no continuous armband)
   - Shorter duration (15 days instead of 30 days)
   - Weekly check-in calls instead of continuous monitoring
4. **If still refuses**: Document patient declined post-acute monitoring (informed refusal), ensure PCP follow-up scheduled within 1 week

**Note**: Cannot force patient to participate, but document education provided and patient's decision

---

### Scenario 4: Extending Acute Care Duration

**Situation**: Patient approaching typical acute care endpoint (e.g., day 7 for CHF), but not quite meeting transition criteria (e.g., still requiring IV diuretics, electrolytes unstable).

**Action**:
1. **Extend acute care** - Do NOT force transition if criteria not met
2. Reassess daily - Why not improving? (diuretic resistance, medication non-adherence, ongoing fluid intake, worsening heart function?)
3. Consider specialist consultation if prolonged course (e.g., cardiology for CHF, pulmonology for COPD)
4. Set maximum acute care duration threshold:
   - If exceeding typical duration by >50% (e.g., CHF >10 days, COPD >10 days) → Consider hospital transfer (may need interventions not available in home setting - cardiac catheterization, bronchoscopy, etc.)

**Quality metric**: Track acute care length of stay - outliers may indicate need for protocol adjustments or patient selection criteria refinement

## Quality Metrics (Transition Success)

**Track these metrics to evaluate transition protocol effectiveness**:

| Metric | Target | Significance |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| **7-day readmission rate** | <5% | Premature transition indicator (if >5%, transition criteria may be too lenient) |
| **30-day readmission rate** | <20% (CHF), <15% (other) | Overall post-acute effectiveness (includes transition quality + post-acute monitoring) |
| **Acute care length of stay** | Within typical range (2-10 days CHF, 3-7 days COPD, etc.) | Efficiency metric (too short = premature transitions, too long = inefficient care) |
| **Device proficiency at transition** | >95% proficiency | Patient readiness for self-management (low proficiency = may need extended training or different devices) |
| **Medication adherence in post-acute phase** | >80% | Transition education effectiveness (low adherence may indicate poor education during transition) |

**Quality improvement**: Monthly review of metrics, identify patterns, adjust transition criteria or process as needed.
