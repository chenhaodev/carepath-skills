## Devices & Monitoring Equipment

See **[Devices Reference](../../shared/devices.md)** for complete specifications.

### Required Devices
- **Everion Armband*** (or alternative continuous monitor)
  - Continuous HR, RR, SpO2, skin temperature, activity
  - Critical for detecting early desaturation and fever
- **Connected BP Cuff**
  - Welch Allyn 1700 OR Omron BP7000
  - Monitor for sepsis (hypotension) or hypertension
- **Connected Pulse Oximeter** (Nonin 3230)
  - If NOT using Everion armband
- **Oral Thermometer**
  - If NOT using Everion
  - **Critical**: Temperature monitoring is key pneumonia parameter

*Optional based on severity and clinician preference per SOP

---

## Daily Monitoring Protocol

### Clinical Team Reviews (Daily)
1. **Physiologic Data Review**
   - **Temperature trends**: Should defervescence by day 3-4 of antibiotics
   - **SpO2**: Should improve with treatment; declining SpO2 indicates complications
   - **Respiratory Rate**: Tachypnea improves as pneumonia resolves
   - **Heart Rate**: Tachycardia improves with treatment

2. **Subjective Patient Data Review**
   - **Daily Pneumonia Symptom Checker**: See **[Pneumonia Questionnaire](../../shared/questionnaires/pneumonia-questionnaire.md)**
     - Antibiotic adherence (prescription filled? taking as prescribed?)
     - Overall improvement ("feeling better?")
     - Cough changes
     - Sputum production and color (yellow/green vs clear)
     - Dyspnea changes
     - Activity tolerance

3. **Patient Task Compliance**
   - Antibiotic administration (critical for treatment success)
   - Temperature monitoring twice daily (week 1)
   - Activity/rest balance

## Alert Thresholds & Escalations

See **[Universal Alert Thresholds](../../shared/alert-thresholds.md)** for complete table.

### Pneumonia-Specific Critical Alerts

| Parameter | Threshold | Clinical Significance | Action |
|-----------|-----------|----------------------|--------|
| **Temperature** | >38.5°C | Active infection, possible treatment failure if persistent >72hrs | **Day 1-3**: Expected<br>**Day 4+**: Consider treatment failure, imaging, culture |
| **SpO2** | <92% | Hypoxemia, severe pneumonia, possible complications | **Urgent**: Increase O2, assess for ARDS, parapneumonic effusion, PE |
| **Respiration Rate** | >24 breaths/min | Respiratory distress, severe pneumonia | **Same-day evaluation**: Chest X-ray, blood cultures if sepsis concern |
| **Heart Rate** | >120 bpm | Sepsis, dehydration, respiratory distress | Assess volume status, infection severity |
| **Systolic BP** | <90 mmHg | **Septic shock** | **EMERGENT**: IV fluids, blood cultures, broad-spectrum antibiotics, hospital transfer |

### Symptom-Based Alerts
- **No improvement after 48-72 hrs antibiotics**: Treatment failure - change antibiotic regimen
- **Worsening dyspnea after initial improvement**: Complication (effusion, empyema, PE)
- **Brown sputum**: Possible hemorrhage or necrotizing pneumonia - **urgent evaluation**
- **Chest pain (pleuritic)**: Parapneumonic effusion or empyema
- **Confusion**: Hypoxemia, sepsis, or meningoencephalitis - **urgent evaluation**

---

## Care Coordination

### Telemedicine/Virtual Visits
- **Daily check-ins** during first 48-72 hours (critical antibiotic period)
- **Every 2-3 days** thereafter if improving
- **Ad-hoc visits** for medication adjustments, treatment failure evaluation

### Interdisciplinary Task Management
- **Phlebotomy**: Blood draws for CBC, CRP, blood cultures (if not improving)
- **Radiology**: Portable chest X-ray if worsening or not improving by day 3-4
- **Antibiotic Administration**: IV or IM antibiotic support if patient unable to take PO

---

## Treatment Protocol

### Antibiotic Selection

#### Outpatient CAP (No Risk Factors)
- **Amoxicillin 1g TID**, OR
- **Doxycycline 100mg BID**, OR
- **Azithromycin 500mg x1, then 250mg daily**

#### Outpatient CAP (With Comorbidities: COPD, CHF, Diabetes, Smoking)
- **Amoxicillin-clavulanate 875mg BID** + **Azithromycin 500mg x1, then 250mg daily**, OR
- **Respiratory fluoroquinolone**: Levofloxacin 750mg daily OR Moxifloxacin 400mg daily

#### Hospital-at-Home CAP (Moderate Severity)
- **IV Ceftriaxone 1-2g daily** + **Azithromycin 500mg daily**, OR
- **IV Ampicillin-sulbactam 1.5-3g q6hrs** + **Azithromycin**, OR
- **Respiratory fluoroquinolone** (levofloxacin 750mg IV daily)

**Duration**: Typically 5-7 days (may extend to 10-14 days for severe CAP)

### Oxygen Therapy
- **Goal**: Maintain SpO2 >92%
- **Titrate**: Start at level needed to achieve target, wean as patient improves
- **Target by day 5-7**: Off supplemental O2 or back to baseline requirement

### Supportive Care
- **Hydration**: 2-3L fluid daily (PO or IV if unable to maintain PO)
- **Nutrition**: Adequate caloric intake for immune function
- **Antipyretics**: Acetaminophen or ibuprofen for fever/discomfort
- **Cough suppression**: Consider if cough interfering with sleep (dextromethorphan)

## Treatment Response Timeline

### Expected Clinical Course

| Day | Expected Changes | Red Flags |
|-----|------------------|-----------|
| **1-2** | Fever may persist, cough may worsen initially | Hemodynamic instability, worsening hypoxia |
| **3-4** | Fever begins to resolve, subjective improvement | Persistent high fever (>38.5°C), no improvement |
| **5-7** | Significant improvement in symptoms, activity tolerance increasing | Worsening dyspnea, new chest pain, relapse of fever |
| **7-14** | Near baseline, completing antibiotic course | Persistent symptoms beyond 2 weeks |

### Treatment Failure Definition
**No clinical improvement after 72 hours** of appropriate antibiotics:
- Persistent fever
- Worsening or unchanged respiratory symptoms
- Declining SpO2
- Hemodynamic instability

**Actions for Treatment Failure**:
1. Obtain chest X-ray (assess for complications)
2. Blood cultures, sputum culture
3. Consider resistant organisms (MRSA, Pseudomonas)
4. Broaden antibiotic coverage
5. Assess for complications (see below)

---

## Complications to Monitor

### Parapneumonic Effusion / Empyema
- **Signs**: Persistent fever, chest pain, dyspnea beyond expected timeline
- **Diagnosis**: Chest X-ray (blunted costophrenic angle), ultrasound
- **Management**: Thoracentesis (diagnostic/therapeutic), possible chest tube

### Lung Abscess
- **Signs**: Persistent fever, foul-smelling sputum, cavitary lesion on imaging
- **Diagnosis**: Chest CT
- **Management**: Prolonged antibiotic course (4-6 weeks), possible drainage

### Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)
- **Signs**: Rapidly worsening hypoxemia, bilateral infiltrates, increased work of breathing
- **Management**: **Hospital transfer** for mechanical ventilation

### Sepsis / Septic Shock
- **Signs**: Hypotension (SBP <90), altered mental status, hyperlactatemia
- **Management**: **EMERGENT hospital transfer**, IV fluids, vasopressors, broad-spectrum antibiotics

### Pulmonary Embolism
- **Context**: Immobility during illness increases VTE risk
- **Signs**: Sudden dyspnea worsening, pleuritic chest pain, tachycardia
- **Management**: D-dimer, CT PE protocol, anticoagulation

---

## Comorbidity Management

See **[Comorbidity Matrix](../../shared/comorbidity-matrix.md)** for detailed guidance.

### Common Pneumonia Comorbidities
- **Pneumonia + COPD**: Bacterial superinfection common, treat both (antibiotics + bronchodilators + steroids)
- **Pneumonia + Diabetes**: Hyperglycemia worsens outcomes - tight glucose control (target <10 mmol/L)
- **Pneumonia + CHF**: Differentiate pulmonary edema from pneumonia infiltrates (BNP, weight trends)
- **Pneumonia + HTN**: Monitor BP (sepsis causes hypotension; dehydration + sympathetic drive may cause HTN)

---

## Transition to Post-Acute Care

### Handoff to Post-Acute
See **[Transition to Post-Acute](./transition-to-postacute.md)** for full protocol.

**Key Handoff Information**:

- Baseline SpO2 and O2 requirements
- Temperature trends (defervescence timeline)
- Follow-up chest X-ray needed? (typically 6 weeks post-treatment in high-risk patients)
- Comorbidities affecting recovery
