## Devices & Monitoring Equipment

See **[Devices Reference](../../shared/devices.md)** for complete specifications.

### Required Devices
- **Everion Armband*** (or alternative continuous monitor)
  - **Critical**: Continuous HR, RR, SpO2, skin temperature, activity
  - Detects "silent hypoxemia" (low SpO2 without dyspnea - unique COVID feature)
- **Connected BP Cuff** (Welch Allyn 1700 OR Omron BP7000)
- **Connected Pulse Oximeter** (Nonin 3230)
  - If NOT using Everion armband
  - Spot checks minimum Q6hrs
- **Oral Thermometer**
  - If NOT using Everion (skin temp surrogate)
  - Twice daily temperature monitoring

*Optional based on severity and clinician preference per SOP

---

## Daily Monitoring Protocol

### Clinical Team Reviews (Daily, Twice Daily During Days 5-10)
1. **Physiologic Data Review**
   - **SpO2 trends**: **MOST CRITICAL COVID PARAMETER**
     - Monitor for "silent hypoxemia" (SpO2 <92% without dyspnea)
     - Check SpO2 with exertion (6-minute walk test at home)
   - **Respiratory Rate**: Tachypnea indicates respiratory distress
   - **Temperature**: Fever curve should trend downward by day 5-7
   - **Heart Rate**: Tachycardia common (inflammation, hypoxia, dehydration)

2. **Subjective Patient Data Review**
   - **Daily COVID Symptom Checker**: See **[COVID Questionnaire](../../shared/questionnaires/covid-questionnaire.md)**
     - **Emergency symptoms** (Section A): Blue lips, chest pain, severe SOB, confusion → **911**
     - Respiratory symptoms: Dyspnea changes, cough
     - Systemic symptoms: Fever, body aches, fatigue, GI symptoms
     - Loss of taste/smell (pathognomonic for COVID)

3. **Patient Task Compliance**
   - Twice daily temperature monitoring
   - SpO2 checks (multiple daily, especially with activity)
   - Medication adherence (antivirals if prescribed)
   - Prone positioning if hypoxic (improves oxygenation)
   - Fluid intake (prevent dehydration)

## Alert Thresholds & Escalations

See **[Universal Alert Thresholds](../../shared/alert-thresholds.md)** for complete table.

### COVID-Specific Critical Alerts

| Parameter | Threshold | Clinical Significance | Action |
|-----------|-----------|----------------------|--------|
| **SpO2** | <92% at rest | Hypoxemic respiratory failure, COVID pneumonia worsening | **URGENT**: Increase O2, assess for hospital transfer, consider steroids/remdesivir |
| **SpO2** | <88% at rest | **Severe hypoxemia** | **EMERGENT**: High-flow O2, hospital transfer likely needed |
| **Respiration Rate** | >30/min | Severe respiratory distress | **Urgent evaluation**: Assess work of breathing, transfer if worsening |
| **Temperature** | >38.5°C + worsening symptoms after day 10 | Possible bacterial superinfection | **Same-day**: Consider antibiotics, chest X-ray |
| **Heart Rate** | >120 bpm + dyspnea | Hypoxia, PE (COVID increases VTE risk), dehydration | **Urgent**: Check SpO2, assess hydration, consider D-dimer/PE workup |

### Emergency Symptoms (CALL 911 IMMEDIATELY)
From **[COVID Questionnaire Section A](../../shared/questionnaires/covid-questionnaire.md)**:
- **Cyanosis**: Blue lips, skin, nail beds
- **Severe chest pain/pressure** (persistent, constant)
- **Severe difficulty breathing**: Gasping, unable to speak, severe accessory muscle use
- **New confusion/disorientation**
- **Unconscious or very difficult to wake**
- **New slurred speech** or difficulty speaking
- **Seizures**
- **Signs of shock**: Too weak to stand, severe dizziness, cold/clammy skin
- **Severe dehydration**: Dry lips/mouth, not urinating, sunken eyes

---

## Care Coordination

### Telemedicine/Virtual Visits
- **Twice daily check-ins** during days 5-10 of illness (critical progression window)
- **Daily check-ins** days 1-4 and days 11-14
- **Ad-hoc visits** for respiratory status changes, treatment decisions

### Interdisciplinary Task Management
- **Phlebotomy**: Home blood draws for CRP, D-dimer, CBC (if indicated)
- **Radiology**: Portable chest X-ray if worsening respiratory status
- **Antiviral Administration**: RN visits for IV remdesivir (if prescribed, 3-day outpatient course)

---

## Treatment Protocol

### Antiviral Therapy (Within 5-7 Days of Symptom Onset)

#### Nirmatrelvir/Ritonavir (Paxlovid) - PREFERRED
- **Indication**: High-risk patients, mild-moderate COVID, within 5 days of symptoms
- **Dose**: Nirmatrelvir 300mg + ritonavir 100mg PO BID x 5 days
- **Efficacy**: Reduces hospitalization by ~89% in high-risk patients
- **Caution**: Extensive drug-drug interactions (ritonavir is CYP3A4 inhibitor)
  - Check interactions with statins, immunosuppressants, anticoagulants
- **Contraindication**: Severe renal/hepatic impairment

#### Remdesivir - Alternative
- **Indication**: High-risk patients unable to take Paxlovid, within 7 days of symptoms
- **Dose**: 200mg IV day 1, then 100mg IV days 2-3 (3-day outpatient course)
- **Efficacy**: Reduces hospitalization by ~87%
- **Administration**: Requires IV access, RN home visits

#### Molnupiravir - Last Resort
- **Indication**: When Paxlovid and remdesivir contraindicated/unavailable
- **Dose**: 800mg PO BID x 5 days
- **Efficacy**: Reduces hospitalization by ~30% (less effective than above)

### Corticosteroids

#### Dexamethasone
- **Indication**: Hospitalized patients requiring supplemental O2 (SpO2 <94% on room air)
- **Dose**: 6mg PO/IV daily x 10 days (or until discharge)
- **Efficacy**: Reduces mortality in hypoxic patients
- **Caution**: May worsen outcomes if given too early (non-hypoxic patients)
- **Monitor**: Hyperglycemia (if diabetic), BP, mood changes

### Oxygen Therapy
- **Goal**: Maintain SpO2 ≥92%
- **Delivery**: Nasal cannula 1-6L/min (escalate as needed)
- **Target range**: SpO2 92-96% (avoid hyperoxia)
- **Prone positioning**: If hypoxic, prone (lying on stomach) 4-6 hrs/day can improve oxygenation by 2-5%

### Supportive Care
- **Hydration**: 2-3L fluid daily (PO or IV if unable)
- **Nutrition**: Adequate caloric intake (increased metabolic demand)
- **Antipyretics**: Acetaminophen or ibuprofen for fever/myalgia
- **Anticoagulation prophylaxis**:
  - Consider low-dose prophylactic anticoagulation for hospitalized patients (VTE risk high)
  - Enoxaparin 40mg SC daily OR Heparin 5000 units SC TID

### Experimental Therapies (Check Current Guidelines)
- **Monoclonal antibodies**: May be available for certain variants (efficacy variant-specific)
- **IL-6 inhibitors** (tocilizumab): For severe cases with cytokine storm
- **Baricitinib**: JAK inhibitor, may be used with remdesivir in severe cases

## Disease Progression Timeline

### COVID Illness Phases

| Phase | Days | Clinical Features | Management Focus |
|-------|------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Early** | 1-5 | Upper respiratory symptoms, fever, myalgia | Antiviral window, symptom management |
| **Critical Window** | 5-10 | **Risk of progression to pneumonia/ARDS** | **Intensive monitoring** (twice daily), oxygen, steroids if hypoxic |
| **Recovery** | 10-14 | Gradual improvement OR complication development | Monitor for superinfection, post-COVID complications |
| **Post-Acute** | 14+ | Most recover OR persistent symptoms (long COVID) | Transition to post-acute care |

**Key Point**: Day 5-10 is critical - patients can deteriorate rapidly. Increase monitoring frequency during this window.

---

## Complications to Monitor

### Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)
- **Signs**: Rapidly worsening hypoxemia (SpO2 <88% on high-flow O2), bilateral infiltrates, increased work of breathing
- **Management**: **Hospital transfer** for mechanical ventilation, prone positioning, paralysis

### Bacterial Superinfection
- **Signs**: Persistent or recurrent fever after day 10, purulent sputum, new infiltrate on CXR
- **Management**: Antibiotics (cover Staph aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, H. influenzae)

### Venous Thromboembolism (VTE)
- **Context**: COVID is hypercoagulable state (inflammation, immobility, hypoxia)
- **Signs**: Sudden dyspnea worsening, pleuritic chest pain, leg swelling
- **Management**: D-dimer, CT PE protocol, anticoagulation

### Myocarditis/Pericarditis
- **Signs**: Chest pain, troponin elevation, ECG changes, arrhythmias
- **Management**: Cardiology consultation, echo, consider NSAIDs, colchicine

### Stroke
- **Context**: COVID increases stroke risk 3-8x (hypercoagulable state)
- **Signs**: Sudden weakness, speech changes, facial droop, vision changes
- **Management**: **CALL 911** - time-sensitive for tPA/thrombectomy

## Comorbidity Management

See **[Comorbidity Matrix](../../shared/comorbidity-matrix.md)** for detailed guidance.

### COVID with Any Comorbidity = Higher Risk
- **COVID + COPD**: Higher mortality, difficult to distinguish from COPD exacerbation
- **COVID + CHF**: Can precipitate CHF exacerbation (myocardial injury, cytokine storm)
- **COVID + Diabetes**: Hyperglycemia worsens outcomes - tight glucose control
- **COVID + HTN**: DO NOT stop ACE-I/ARBs (no evidence of harm, may be protective)
- **COVID + Immunocompromised**: Higher risk severe disease, longer viral shedding

---

## Transition to Post-Acute Care

### Discharge Readiness Criteria
- ✅ SpO2 stable ≥92% on room air OR ≤4L O2
- ✅ Respiratory rate <24, work of breathing improved
- ✅ Afebrile x24 hours (or fever resolving)
- ✅ Past critical window (day 10+) with improving trajectory
- ✅ Able to maintain hydration and nutrition
- ✅ No signs of complications (PE, superinfection, ARDS)
- ✅ Isolation requirements met per CDC (typically 10 days from symptom onset + improving symptoms)

### Handoff to Post-Acute
See **[Transition to Post-Acute](./transition-to-postacute.md)** for full protocol.

**Key Handoff Information**:
- Day of illness (from symptom onset)
- Peak severity reached
- Oxygen requirement timeline (for 14-day post-acute monitoring)
- Antiviral course completion date
- Comorbidities affected by COVID
- Long COVID risk assessment (persistent symptoms >4 weeks)
