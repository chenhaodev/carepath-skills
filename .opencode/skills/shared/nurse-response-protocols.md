# Nurse-Driven Response Protocols

**Purpose**: Operational workflows for registered nurses responding to vital sign alerts in remote patient monitoring programs.

**Source**: Extracted from Carepath-Logic.pdf flowcharts via OCR

**Coverage**: CHF, COPD, Hypertension

**Note**: These are **nurse-driven protocols** for immediate response when alerts fire. For complete clinical pathways, see disease-specific acute care references.

---

## How to Use These Protocols

**When to use**:
- Vital sign alert received from remote monitoring device
- Patient reports symptoms consistent with disease exacerbation
- Scheduled check-in reveals out-of-range parameters

**Protocol flow**:
1. **Validate equipment** (rule out false alarms)
2. **Repeat vitals** to confirm alert
3. **Telehealth visit** (video preferred over phone)
4. **Assess patient presentation** (symptoms, comorbidities)
5. **Review MAR** (medication administration record)
6. **Instruct PRN medications** (if available and indicated)
7. **Monitor response** (wait 30-60 minutes, reassess)
8. **Escalate** if no improvement or critical symptoms

**Escalation levels**:
- **Document and monitor**: Stable, responding to interventions
- **Provider notification**: Needs medication adjustment or clinical evaluation
- **Call 911**: Life-threatening symptoms (see emergency criteria each protocol)

## Protocol 1: CHF Exacerbation Management

### Trigger

**Alert received**:
- Weight gain >2-3 lbs in 24 hours, OR
- Vital signs out of parameters (SpO2, HR, RR, BP), OR
- Patient reports symptoms consistent with CHF

### Nurse Triage Workflow

#### Step 1: Validate Alert

**Repeat vitals**:
- Weight
- Blood pressure (BP)
- Oxygen saturation (SpO2)
- Heart rate (HR)
- Respiratory rate (RR)

**If equipment validated and vitals normal** → Continue to monitor (no further action)

**If vitals out of parameters** → Proceed to Step 2

---

#### Step 2: Telehealth Visit (Required)

**Video visit strongly preferred over phone only**

**Telemedicine considerations**:
- **Edema check**: Lower extremities, sacral area
- **Orthopnea assessment**: "How many pillows do you need to sleep?"
- **Breathing effort**: Using accessory muscles? Pursed-lip breathing?
- **Cough**: Dry, hacky, or frothy? (frothy = pulmonary edema)
- **SpO2**: Check for hypoxia

---

#### Step 3: Patient Assessment

**Review chart**:
- History of MI (myocardial infarction)?
- CAD (coronary artery disease)?
- Comorbidities? (diabetes, COPD, kidney disease)

**Evaluate MAR** (Medication Administration Record):
- **Oxygen**: Home concentrator settings (1-6 L/min typical)
- **Diuretics**: Lasix (furosemide), Bumex (bumetanide)
- **ACE-I/ARB**: Ace inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers
- **PRN medications**: As-needed diuretics available?

**CHF symptom checklist** (Table 1):
- ✓ Dyspnea on exertion
- ✓ Nighttime cough
- ✓ Shortness of breath at rest
- ✓ Swelling in legs
- ✓ Weight gain
- ✓ Difficulty breathing when laying flat (orthopnea)
- ✓ Wheezing
- ✓ Fatigue

---

#### Step 4: Intervention (If PRN Diuretic Available)

**If PRN diuretic is ordered in MAR**:
1. **Instruct patient** to take prescribed PRN diuretic
   - Confirm BP give/hold parameters (e.g., "Hold if SBP <100")
   - Patient may self-administer if capable

2. **Wait 30-60 minutes**

3. **Repeat RN evaluation**:
   - Repeat vitals
   - Assess symptom improvement
   - Check if patient urinated (diuretic effect)

**If improved** → Continue to closely monitor q30min × 4, then reassess

**If NOT improved** → Proceed to escalation

---

#### Step 5: Patient Education & Monitoring

**Counsel patient on**:
- **Medication compliance**: Take all prescribed CHF medications
- **Low-salt diet**: <2g sodium/day
- **Self-care**: Daily weights, report weight gain ≥3 lbs in 3 days
- **Action plan**: Review when to call nurse vs when to call 911

**Close monitoring**:
- q30min × 4 hours
- Document all findings
- Note in hand-off for next shift

**Re-enter pathway** for any decompensation noted

---

#### Step 6: Escalation Criteria

**Call on-call service to contact appropriate provider if**:
- Patient stable but not improving with PRN diuretic
- Needs medication adjustment or additional orders
- Uncertain if patient can wait for routine specialist consult

**Provider will determine**:
- Increase diuretic dose?
- Add IV diuretics (transition to acute care)?
- Schedule urgent clinic visit?

**Emergently escalate - Call 911 if**:
- **SpO2 <90%** and breathing effort continues to decline
- Chest pain (rule out MI)
- Confusion or altered mental status
- Severe respiratory distress

---

## Protocol 2: COPD Exacerbation Management

### Trigger

**Alert received**:
- Decreased SpO2 from baseline, OR
- Respiratory rate increase

### Nurse Triage Workflow

#### Step 1: Validate Alert

**Repeat vitals**:
- SpO2 (target 88-92% for COPD - NOT 95%+)
- Respiratory rate (normal 12-20, alert >25/min)

**If equipment validated and vitals normal** → Continue to monitor

**If SpO2 <88% and/or RR >25/min** → Proceed to Step 2

---

#### Step 2: Immediate Interventions

**Pursed-lip breathing strategy**:
- Educate/assist patient with technique
- Reduces anxiety and work of breathing

**Telehealth visit** (video strongly preferred):
- Assess work of breathing (using accessory muscles?)
- Observe respiratory pattern
- Patient appearance (anxious? cyanotic?)

---

#### Step 3: Patient Assessment

**Presentation checklist**:
- Increased work of breathing?
- Wheezing?
- Cough - productive or dry?
- **Sputum change**: Color (clear → yellow/green = purulent, possible infection)

**Chart review**:
- **Comorbidities**: More than 1 care pathway? (CHF, pneumonia, COVID)
- If new symptoms → consider other pathway, escalate to provider

**Evaluate MAR**:
- **Oxygen**: Home concentrator (1-6 L/min typical)
  - Orders visible in EMR
- **PRN medications**:
  - Duoneb (albuterol + ipratropium nebulizer)
  - Inhaler with spacer?
  - Metered-dose inhaler (MDI)?

---

#### Step 4: Assessment Questions

**Ask patient**:
- Is O2 still <88%?
- Symptomatic? (short of breath, wheezing)
- This their baseline SpO2? (COPD patients often 88-92% normally)

**If SpO2 at baseline and asymptomatic** → Continue monitoring

**If symptomatic or below baseline** → Proceed to interventions

---

#### Step 5: Comorbidity Check

**Screen for overlapping pathways**:
- **Weight gain**, leg swelling, chest pain, orthopnea → Consider **CHF**
- **Fever** → Consider **pneumonia/COVID**

**If positive for comorbidity signs** → Escalate to provider (may need additional pathway)

---

#### Step 6: Medication Interventions

**If medications ordered in MAR**:

**Option 1 - Nebulizer** (preferred):
1. **Administer Duoneb or albuterol** nebulizer treatment
2. **Wait 30 minutes**
3. **Reassess vitals**: SpO2 ≥88%? RR ≤25/min?

**Option 2 - Metered-dose inhaler** (if no nebulizer):
1. **1st dose**: 1-2 puffs with spacer
2. **Wait 30 minutes**
3. **If no improvement**: 2nd dose (1 puff)

**Oxygen adjustment** (if prescribed):
- **Increase O2 by 1-2 L/min** per MAR orders
- **Caution**: Over-oxygenation can suppress respiratory drive in COPD
- **Target SpO2**: 88-92% (not higher)

---

#### Step 7: Monitoring & Reassessment

**After intervention**:
- **Wait 30 minutes**
- **Repeat vitals**: SpO2, RR
- **Assess improvement**:
  - Breathing easier?
  - SpO2 improved?
  - RR decreased?

**If improved** → Continue to closely monitor q30min × 4

**If NOT improved** → Escalate to provider

---

#### Step 8: Escalation Criteria

**Escalate to provider or on-call** if:
- No improvement after PRN medications
- Need to discuss change of O2 parameters
- Patient needs steroid burst or antibiotics (for purulent sputum)

**Call on-call service** for provider contact if:
- Patient stable to wait for specialist consult
- Uncertain about next steps

**Emergently escalate - Call 911 if**:
- **SpO2 <85%** despite interventions
- **RR >30/min** or severe respiratory distress
- **Breathing effort continues to decline**
- Confusion or altered mental status (CO2 retention sign)
- Severe chest pain

---

## Protocol 3: Hypertension Management

### Trigger

**Alert received**:
- Increased systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure (above parameters), OR
- Decreased blood pressure (hypotension concern)

### Nurse Triage Workflow

#### Step 1: Validate Alert

**Repeat vitals**:
- Diastolic BP
- Systolic BP

**If BP within parameters upon repeat** → Equipment validated, continue to monitor

**If BP still out of parameters** → Proceed to Step 2

---

#### Step 2: Telehealth Visit (Required)

**Video visit strongly preferred over phone only**

**Patient assessment - screen for symptoms**:
- **Chest pain** (MI risk)
- **Headache** (hypertensive emergency sign)
- **Change in vision** (blurred, double vision)
- **Shortness of breath or dyspnea**
- **Nausea/vomiting**
- **Weakness** (stroke concern)

**If ANY severe symptoms present** → Immediate escalation (possible hypertensive emergency)

---

#### Step 3: Baseline Assessment

**Ask patient**:
- "Is this your normal/baseline BP?"
  - If **yes** (patient runs high) → May not need urgent intervention
  - If **no** (elevated from their norm) → Proceed to intervention

**Has patient taken prescribed medications today?**
- If **yes** → Medications not controlling BP, escalate to provider
- If **no** → Medication non-adherence issue

---

#### Step 4: Chart Review

**Review comorbidities and risk factors**:
- **HTN risk factors**: CAD, PAD (peripheral arterial disease), CVD (cardiovascular disease)
- **More than 1 care pathway?**: Consider **CHF** if patient also has heart failure

**Evaluate MAR**:
- **Antihypertensives**: What is patient prescribed?
- **Diuretics**: Any diuretic for volume overload?
- **Short-acting agents**: PRN medications available?
- **Long-acting agents**: Daily maintenance meds?

---

#### Step 5: Non-Pharmacological Interventions

**Patient education on lifestyle modifications**:
1. **Physical activity**: 30 minutes/day or 150 minutes/week
2. **Weight management**: If overweight, discuss weight loss
3. **Reducing dietary sodium**: <2g/day (review salt intake)
4. **Limiting alcohol consumption**: ≤2 drinks/day (men), ≤1 drink/day (women)
5. **DASH diet**: Low-fat, high calcium, high fruit/vegetable diet
6. **Smoking cessation**: If applicable

**Relaxation/breathing techniques** for non-pharmacological BP reduction:
- Deep breathing exercises
- Progressive muscle relaxation
- Reduce anxiety/stress

---

#### Step 6: Medication Interventions

**If patient has NOT taken prescribed meds**:
1. **Instruct patient to take prescribed medications**
2. **Provide compliance education**: Importance of daily adherence
3. **Assess for medication barriers**:
   - Cost issues?
   - Side effects?
   - Forgetfulness?
   - "Feel fine without meds"?

**If PRN antihypertensive/diuretic available**:
1. **Assess for PRN medication indications** (per MAR orders)
2. **Instruct on use as prescribed**:
   - When to take (e.g., "If SBP >160")
   - Give/hold parameters
3. **Patient may self-administer** if capable

---

#### Step 7: Monitoring & Reassessment

**Reassess BP 1 hour after**:
- PRN medications given, OR
- Interventions provided (relaxation techniques), OR
- Education on contributing factors

**Document**:
- Initial BP
- Interventions provided
- 1-hour repeat BP
- Patient response

**If improved** → Continue monitoring, document in hand-off

**If NOT improved** → Escalate to provider

---

#### Step 8: Escalation Criteria

**Provider escalation needed if**:
- BP not controlled despite adherence and PRN meds
- Need medication dose adjustment
- New antihypertensive needed
- *Provider request for change of parameters*

**Call on-call service** if:
- Patient stable to wait for specialist consult
- Uncertain about next steps

**Emergently escalate - Call 911 for**:
- **Severe neurological symptoms**:
  - Sudden severe headache
  - Vision changes (sudden blindness, double vision)
  - Weakness on one side (stroke)
  - Slurred speech
  - Confusion or altered mental status
- **Severe chest pain** (possible MI)
- **Severe shortness of breath** (pulmonary edema)
- **Hypertensive emergency** (SBP >180 mmHg with end-organ damage symptoms)

## Oncology-Specific Response Protocols

### Febrile Neutropenia Protocol (MEDICAL EMERGENCY)

**Trigger**: Temperature ≥38°C in patient on active chemotherapy OR known neutropenia (ANC <1000)

**Immediate Actions** (within 15 minutes):
1. **DO NOT** wait for lab confirmation of neutropenia
2. Notify oncology team immediately
3. Direct patient to nearest Emergency Department
4. If patient calls from home:
   - Advise: "Go to Emergency now, do not wait"
   - Inform ED of incoming febrile neutropenia patient
   - Notify oncologist on-call

**ED Handoff** (ensure communicated):
- "Patient on chemotherapy with fever - FEBRILE NEUTROPENIA PROTOCOL"
- Recent chemo regimen and date
- Baseline ANC if known
- Allergies (especially to antibiotics)

**Goal**: Door-to-antibiotic time <60 minutes ("Golden Hour")

**Reference**: See [`../carepath-oncology/references/symptom-febrile-neutropenia.md`](../carepath-oncology/references/symptom-febrile-neutropenia.md)

### Suicide Risk Response Protocol (C-SSRS-Based)

**Trigger**: Positive screening on Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)

| Risk Level | Criteria | Response | Timeline |
|------------|----------|----------|----------|
| **🔴 HIGH RISK** | Ideation + Plan + Intent OR Recent attempt OR Preparatory behavior | 1. Call 911 for ambulance transport<br>2. DO NOT LEAVE PATIENT ALONE<br>3. Notify oncologist + MSW/psychologist immediately<br>4. Remove means (medications, sharps) | **IMMEDIATE** |
| **🟠 MODERATE RISK** | Ideation + Method, no specific plan OR Past attempt (>1 month ago) | 1. Same-day psychiatry consult<br>2. Create safety plan<br>3. Notify family/support person<br>4. Remove access to means<br>5. Daily follow-up until psychiatry seen | **Same day** |
| **🟡 LOW RISK** | Passive ideation, no plan or intent | 1. MSW/psychologist referral<br>2. Provide crisis hotline number<br>3. Safety assessment<br>4. Follow-up within 48 hours | **Within 48h** |

**Crisis Resources**:
- National Suicide Prevention Lifeline: 988 (US)
- Singapore: Samaritans of Singapore (SOS) 1-767

**Reference**: See [`../carepath-oncology/references/symptom-distress.md`](../carepath-oncology/references/symptom-distress.md)

---

### Immunosuppressed Patient Infection Protocol

**Trigger**: ANY infection symptom in patient on chemotherapy within 4 weeks

| Symptom | Immunosuppressed* | Non-Immunosuppressed |
|---------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **Fever, Cough, Diarrhea, Dysuria** | → Chemo Review Clinic OR Emergency (if after hours) | → Polyclinic OR Emergency (if severe) |

*Immunosuppressed = Active chemotherapy, stem cell transplant recipient, high-dose steroids

**Rationale**: Infections progress rapidly in immunosuppressed patients. Do not delay with "wait and see" approach.

## Universal Nursing Principles Across All Protocols

### Documentation Requirements

**Every alert response must document**:
1. **Initial vitals** (before intervention)
2. **Patient assessment** (symptoms, presentation)
3. **Chart review findings** (comorbidities, MAR review)
4. **Interventions provided** (medications, education, non-pharmacological)
5. **Response to interventions** (repeat vitals, symptom improvement)
6. **Escalation decision** (why escalated or why continued monitoring)
7. **Hand-off note** for next shift

### Telehealth Best Practices

**Video visit strongly preferred over phone-only** because:
- Visual assessment: Work of breathing, edema, skin color, patient distress
- Environmental assessment: Home oxygen setup, medication compliance
- Rapport building: Better patient engagement
- Documentation: Can screenshot if needed (with consent)

**Phone-only acceptable if**:
- Patient lacks video capability
- Technical issues prevent video
- Time-sensitive situation requires immediate contact

### PRN Medication Safety

**Before instructing patient to take PRN medication**:
1. **Verify order in MAR**: Medication, dose, indication, give/hold parameters
2. **Confirm patient capability**: Can self-administer? Cognitive status OK?
3. **Provide clear instructions**:
   - "Take [medication] [dose] now for [indication]"
   - "Do NOT take if [hold parameters]" (e.g., "Hold if BP <100/60")
4. **Set expectation**: "Call me back in 30 minutes" or "I'll call you in 1 hour"
5. **Document**: Time instructed, patient understanding confirmed

### Escalation Decision-Making

**Escalate to provider if**:
- No improvement after appropriate interventions
- Patient requires medication adjustment beyond PRN
- Comorbidity complicating picture (multiple pathways)
- Uncertain about safety of waiting for routine follow-up

**Call 911 immediately if**:
- Life-threatening symptoms (see emergency criteria each protocol)
- Vital signs critically abnormal despite interventions
- Patient safety at risk

**When in doubt, escalate.** Patient safety always takes precedence.

## Integration with Carepath Skills

These nurse-driven protocols complement the existing Carepath skills:

| Carepath Skill | Nurse Protocol Focus |
|----------------|---------------------|
| **carepath-acute SKILL.md** | What to monitor, devices, thresholds | **Nurse protocols** | What to DO when alert fires |
| **Disease-specific references** | Clinical pathways, treatment overview | **Nurse protocols** | Step-by-step response workflows |
| **Alert thresholds** | When to trigger alerts | **Nurse protocols** | How to respond to alerts |

**Recommended workflow**:
1. **Alert fires** → Nurse uses **this protocol** for immediate response
2. **Protocol completed** → Document in **disease-specific pathway** (e.g., CHF acute)
3. **Escalation needed** → Review **disease reference** for clinical context

## Disclaimer

These protocols are **nurse-driven response guidelines** for registered nurses providing remote patient monitoring. They do NOT replace:
- Physician orders (always follow current orders in MAR)
- Clinical judgment (protocols are guides, not absolute rules)
- Local institutional policies (defer to your facility's protocols if different)
- Specialist consultation (when uncertain, escalate)

**Always prioritize patient safety.** When in doubt, escalate.
