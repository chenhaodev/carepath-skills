# Hypertension (HTN) Symptom Checker

### Purpose
Daily assessment for symptoms of severe hypertension, hypertensive urgency, and hypotension (medication over-treatment). Monitors blood pressure control and medication tolerance.

### Administration Frequency
- **Acute Care**: Daily during hypertensive urgency management (2-4 days)
- **Post-Acute Care**: Daily for first 30 days during medication optimization

## Daily HTN Symptom Checker

| Question # | Question | Clinical Focus |
|------------|----------|----------------|
| 1 | Do you have severe **headache**? | Hypertensive urgency symptom |
| 2 | Do you have **chest pain**? | Hypertensive emergency / ACS |
| 3 | Do you have **shortness of breath**? | Pulmonary edema / flash APE |
| 4 | Do you have **dizziness or lightheadedness**? | Hypotension / over-treatment |

## Clinical Interpretation

### Hypertensive Urgency/Emergency Symptoms

#### Severe Headache (Q1)
**Red Flags**:
- New-onset severe headache with BP ≥180/100
- "Worst headache of my life"
- Headache unresponsive to usual analgesics

**Clinical Significance**:
- May indicate hypertensive urgency
- Rule out hypertensive encephalopathy if + confusion (Q6)
- Rule out secondary causes: SAH, ICH, tumor

**Correlation with Vitals**:
- Document concurrent BP reading
- BP ≥180 systolic with severe headache → Urgent evaluation
- Consider neuroimaging if encephalopathy signs present

#### Chest Pain (Q2)
**Red Flags**:
- Pressure/crushing chest pain
- Pain radiating to arm, jaw, back
- Associated dyspnea or diaphoresis

**Clinical Significance**:
- **Hypertensive emergency with ACS**: Requires immediate hospital transfer
- Severe HTN can precipitate myocardial ischemia
- HTN is both cause and consequence of ACS

**Immediate Actions**:
- Obtain 12-lead ECG
- Assess for STEMI/NSTEMI
- Emergency transfer if acute coronary syndrome confirmed
- Do NOT aggressively lower BP in acute stroke/ACS (perfusion-dependent)

#### Shortness of Breath (Q3)
**Red Flags**:
- Acute onset dyspnea
- Orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea
- Pink frothy sputum (frank pulmonary edema)

**Clinical Significance**:
- **Flash acute pulmonary edema (APE)**: Hypertensive emergency
- Severe HTN → increased LV afterload → acute LV dysfunction → pulmonary edema
- May also indicate CHF exacerbation triggered by HTN

**Immediate Actions**:
- Check BP immediately
- Assess SpO2
- Listen for crackles (pulmonary edema)
- If flash APE: IV diuretics, vasodilators, emergency transfer

#### Dizziness/Lightheadedness (Q4)
**Clinical Significance**:
- **Most commonly**: Hypotension from over-treatment
- Antihypertensive medications causing orthostatic hypotension
- Volume depletion (diuretics)

**Assessment**:
- Document BP reading when symptoms occur
- Check orthostatic vitals (lying → standing BP)
- Orthostatic drop >20 systolic or >10 diastolic → Positive

**Management**:
- Systolic BP <90 with symptoms → Hold antihypertensives
- Review diuretic dosing
- Assess volume status (dry mucous membranes, poor skin turgor)
- Consider medication adjustment: reduce dose or frequency

#### Visual Abnormalities (Q5)
**Red Flags**:
- Sudden vision changes
- Blurred vision not corrected by glasses
- Seeing flashing lights or spots (scotomas)
- Vision loss (partial or complete)

**Clinical Significance**:
- **Hypertensive retinopathy**: BP-related retinal damage
- **Hypertensive encephalopathy**: Visual changes with CNS involvement
- **Acute angle-closure glaucoma**: Can be triggered by severe HTN
- **Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES)**: HTN emergency

**Assessment**:
- Document BP at time of visual symptoms
- Fundoscopic exam (if trained): Hemorrhages, exudates, papilledema
- BP ≥180/120 with vision changes → Hypertensive emergency

**Immediate Actions**:
- BP >180/120 + vision changes → Emergency evaluation
- Urgent ophthalmology consult if acute vision loss
- Neuroimaging if CNS signs present

#### Confusion/Cognitive Impairment (Q6)
**Red Flags**:
- Altered mental status
- Disorientation
- Decreased level of consciousness
- Seizures

**Clinical Significance**:
- **Hypertensive encephalopathy**: Medical emergency
  - Triad: Severe HTN + headache + altered mental status
  - Cerebral edema from BP exceeding autoregulation
- **Stroke**: Hemorrhagic or ischemic (HTN is major risk factor)
- **PRES**: Usually reversible if BP controlled

**Immediate Actions**:
- BP >180/120 + confusion → **Hypertensive emergency**
- Emergency transfer for controlled BP lowering (ICU)
- Neuroimaging (CT head → MRI) to rule out stroke/hemorrhage
- Do NOT lower BP precipitously (risk of stroke extension)

## Clinical Decision Support

### Symptom Severity Classification

| Symptom Pattern | Classification | Urgency | Action |
|----------------|----------------|---------|--------|
| **No symptoms, BP <180/100** | Controlled HTN | Routine | Continue monitoring |
| **No symptoms, BP ≥180/100** | Asymptomatic severe HTN | Same-day | Medication adjustment, recheck BP in 6-12 hrs |
| **1 symptom (mild), BP 160-179/100-109** | Symptomatic HTN | Same-day | Medication adjustment, clinical evaluation |
| **≥2 symptoms, BP ≥180/110** | **Hypertensive urgency** | **Urgent (2-4 hrs)** | Oral antihypertensive, close monitoring |
| **Chest pain / SOB / Confusion, BP ≥180/120** | **Hypertensive emergency** | **Immediate (911)** | Emergency transfer, IV medications |

### Hypotension Symptoms

| Symptom Pattern | Classification | Action |
|----------------|----------------|--------|
| Dizziness + BP 90-100 systolic | Borderline low | Hold next antihypertensive dose, reassess |
| Dizziness + BP <90 systolic | Symptomatic hypotension | Hold all antihypertensives, increase fluids, clinical evaluation |
| Dizziness + orthostatic drop | Orthostatic hypotension | Reduce diuretic, adjust dosing times, volume replacement |

## Medication Adherence Assessment

While not a formal questionnaire item, the following should be assessed concurrently:

| Assessment | Question to Ask | Clinical Significance |
|------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| Adherence | "Did you take all your BP medications as prescribed?" | Non-adherence is #1 cause of uncontrolled HTN |
| Side effects | "Are you experiencing any bothersome side effects?" | Side effects → non-adherence |
| Barriers | "Any difficulty getting medications?" | Cost, transportation barriers common |
| Diet | "How is your salt intake?" | High sodium blunts medication effectiveness |

---

## Correlation with BP Measurements

### BP Interpretation with Symptoms

| BP Reading | With Symptoms | Without Symptoms |
|------------|---------------|------------------|
| **<90 systolic** | Symptomatic hypotension - hold meds | Asymptomatic - assess trends, consider dose reduction |
| **90-120/60-80** | Therapeutic target (if no symptoms) | Goal achieved - continue current regimen |
| **140-179/90-99** | Stage 2 HTN - adjust meds | Medication optimization needed |
| **≥180/≥110** | Hypertensive urgency if symptomatic | Hypertensive urgency - urgent evaluation even if asymptomatic |
| **≥180/≥120** | **Hypertensive emergency** if end-organ symptoms | Severe HTN - urgent same-day evaluation |

### Timing of BP Measurements

- **Twice daily** minimum (morning and evening)
- **Additional measurements** if symptoms occur
- **Orthostatic vitals** if dizziness reported
- **Document activity and posture** (sitting, standing, lying)

**Clinical Note**: This questionnaire screens for symptoms of hypertensive complications and medication intolerance. BP values alone without symptoms are managed differently than symptomatic HTN. Always correlate symptoms with concurrent BP readings. Hypertensive emergencies (end-organ damage symptoms) require immediate hospital transfer, not outpatient management.
