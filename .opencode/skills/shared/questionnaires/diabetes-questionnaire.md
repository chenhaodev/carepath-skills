# Diabetes Questionnaire

### Purpose
Daily symptom assessment for patients with diabetes (Type 1 or Type 2) focusing on hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia symptoms, medication adherence, and contributing factors.

### Administration Frequency
- **Acute Care**: Daily during hyperglycemia/DKA/HHS management (2-5 days)
- **Post-Acute Care**: Daily for 30 days during glucose optimization

## Daily Diabetes Symptom Checker

### Screening Question
"Have you had any **abnormal blood glucose readings** in the last 24 hours? OR have you had any symptoms of:
- Low blood glucose (e.g., sweating, palpitations, confusion, dizziness)
- High blood glucose (e.g., increased thirst, dry mouth, increased urination, hunger, blurry vision, fatigue)"

**If YES** → Complete full questionnaire below
**If NO** → End survey (no concerning symptoms)

## Clinical Interpretation

### Hypoglycemia (Section A)

#### Severity Classification

| Response Pattern | Severity | Action |
|------------------|----------|--------|
| A1: No symptoms | None | Continue monitoring |
| A1: Single episode <15 min | Mild hypoglycemia | Review glucose logs, identify triggers, reinforce 15-15 rule |
| A1: Multiple episodes OR >15 min | **Severe/prolonged hypoglycemia** | **Urgent**: Medication adjustment required, clinical evaluation |

#### Common Causes to Address (A2)

**Medication-related** (Most common):
- "Wrong amount/timing": Insulin/sulfonylurea dosing error
  - Action: Medication education, consider dose reduction
- "Took medicine but skipped meal": Timing mismatch
  - Action: Synchronize meal and medication times

**Dietary-related**:
- "Ate too little" or "Skipped meal": Insufficient carbohydrate intake
  - Action: Dietician referral, meal planning support
- "Waited too long to eat": Delayed meal
  - Action: Scheduled snacks, consistent meal times

**Activity-related**:
- "More physical activity than usual": Exercise-induced hypoglycemia
  - Action: Pre-exercise snack, post-exercise glucose monitoring
  - Consider reducing insulin dose on exercise days

**Illness-related**:
- "Sick or had infection": Decreased oral intake during illness
  - Action: Sick day management plan
  - Consider temporary insulin dose reduction

**Stress-related**:
- "Stressed, upset, angry": Variable effect (usually hyperglycemia, but can cause hypoglycemia if leads to skipped meals)
  - Action: Stress management, consistent routine

### Hyperglycemia (Section B)

#### Severity Classification

| Response Pattern | Severity | Clinical Concern |
|------------------|----------|------------------|
| B1: No symptoms | None | Review glucose logs |
| B1: Single episode <15 min | Mild hyperglycemia | Pattern assessment, medication adherence check |
| B1: Multiple episodes OR >15 min + D3 (N/V) | **Severe hyperglycemia / possible DKA** | **Urgent evaluation**: Check ketones, assess for DKA/HHS |

#### DKA/HHS Warning Signs

**Red Flag Combinations**:
- B1 = Yes (hyperglycemia symptoms) + D3 = Yes (nausea/vomiting)
- Glucose >16.7 mmol/L (>300 mg/dL) + symptoms
- Confusion (D2) + hyperglycemia

**Immediate Actions**:
- Check blood ketones (if Type 1 or insulin-dependent)
- Assess for DKA: Glucose, ketones, anion gap, pH
- Urgent clinical evaluation if ketones elevated

#### Common Causes to Address (B2)

**Medication non-adherence** (Most common):
- "Missed dose" or "Wrong amount/time": Non-adherence
  - Action: Assess barriers (cost, complexity, side effects)
  - Consider simplified regimen

**Dietary-related**:
- "Ate inappropriate food" or "Ate more than usual": Carbohydrate excess
  - Action: Carbohydrate counting education, dietician referral
  - Review glycemic index concepts

**Activity-related**:
- "Less physical activity": Reduced insulin sensitivity
  - Action: Increase activity, adjust insulin for sedentary days

**Illness-related**:
- "Sick or had infection": Stress hyperglycemia
  - Action: Sick day management plan
  - May need temporary insulin increase during illness

**Stress-related**:
- "Stressed, upset, angry": Cortisol-mediated hyperglycemia
  - Action: Stress management, consider short-term insulin adjustment

### Medication Adherence (Section C)

| Response | Interpretation | Action |
|----------|---------------|--------|
| C1: Yes | Adherent | Reinforce, continue |
| C1: No, C2: "Forgot" | Unintentional non-adherence | Reminders, pill box, smartphone alarms |
| C1: No, C2: "Other" reasons | Intentional non-adherence | Explore: cost, side effects, beliefs, complexity |

**Common "Other" Reasons**:
- **Cost**: Connect to patient assistance programs, generic alternatives
- **Side effects**: Nausea, hypoglycemia, weight gain → Medication switch
- **Complexity**: Multiple daily injections, complicated regimen → Simplify
- **Denial/Fear**: Psychological barriers → Diabetes educator, counseling

### Associated Symptoms (Section D)

**Fatigue (D1)**:
- With hyperglycemia → Uncontrolled diabetes
- With hypoglycemia → Recurrent lows causing fatigue
- Without glucose abnormalities → Rule out: Anemia, thyroid, depression, sleep apnea

**Dizziness/Confusion (D2)**:
- **With hypoglycemia** (A1=Yes): Neuroglycopenia - urgent treatment
- **With hyperglycemia** (B1=Yes): Severe hyperglycemia/DKA → Urgent evaluation
- Without glucose abnormalities → Rule out: Orthostatic hypotension (medications), cardiovascular

**GI Symptoms (D3)**:
- **With hyperglycemia**: Possible DKA (nausea/vomiting from ketoacidosis)
- **With medications**: Metformin (diarrhea), GLP-1 (nausea)
- Without glucose abnormalities → Rule out: Gastroenteritis, gastroparesis, medication side effect

---

## Correlation with Glucose Monitoring

### Glucose Log Review

**Q6 hourly glucose readings** (categorized by timing):
- **Fasting** (morning, before breakfast)
- **Pre-meal** (before lunch, before dinner)
- **Post-meal** (2 hours after each meal)
- **Bedtime**

#### Pattern Recognition

| Glucose Pattern | Clinical Interpretation | Adjustment |
|----------------|------------------------|------------|
| **Fasting high** (>7.0 mmol/L) | Insufficient basal insulin or overnight hepatic gluconeogenesis | Increase basal insulin (evening dose) |
| **Post-meal spikes** (>10.0 mmol/L 2hr post-meal) | Insufficient bolus insulin or excessive carbs | Increase mealtime insulin OR reduce carbs |
| **Pre-meal lows** (<4.0 mmol/L) | Excessive basal insulin OR insufficient carb intake | Reduce basal insulin OR add snack |
| **Bedtime lows** (<5.0 mmol/L) | Risk of nocturnal hypoglycemia | Reduce evening insulin OR bedtime snack |
| **Variable/erratic** | Poor adherence, stress, illness, or erratic meals | Address underlying cause, simplify regimen |

## Clinical Decision Support

### Hypoglycemia Management

#### Immediate Treatment (15-15 Rule)
1. Consume 15g fast-acting carbohydrate (4 glucose tablets, 120ml juice, 1 tbsp honey)
2. Recheck glucose in 15 minutes
3. If still <4.0 mmol/L, repeat step 1
4. Once glucose >4.0 mmol/L, eat a meal or snack to prevent recurrence

#### Prevention Strategies
- Consistent meal times
- Carry glucose tabs/snacks always
- Check glucose before driving
- Educate family on glucagon use (severe hypoglycemia)

### Hyperglycemia Management

#### Short-Term Adjustments
- **Glucose 10-15 mmol/L**: Increase physical activity, review diet
- **Glucose 15-20 mmol/L**: Consider supplemental insulin (if on insulin), recheck in 2-4 hours
- **Glucose >20 mmol/L + symptoms**: Urgent clinical evaluation

#### Long-Term Optimization
- HbA1c target: <7.0% (individualize based on age, comorbidities)
- Medication intensification if consistently above target
- Consider continuous glucose monitor (CGM) for pattern recognition

**Clinical Note**: This questionnaire assesses subjective symptoms. Always correlate with objective glucose readings (SMBG, CGM) and HbA1c trends. Recurrent hypoglycemia indicates need for medication reduction; recurrent hyperglycemia indicates need for intensification. Patient education on self-management is critical for diabetes control.
