## Clinical Interpretation

### Section A: Pulmonary Embolism (PE) Assessment

PE is the most serious complication of DVT. These symptoms require urgent evaluation.

#### Fever + Chills/Sweats (A1 + A2)

**Interpretation**:
- **Fever with DVT**: Two primary concerns:
  1. **Septic thrombophlebitis** (infected clot)
  2. **Pulmonary embolism** (inflammatory response)

**Red Flags**:
- Fever >38.5°C
- Fever + chills/rigors (suggests septic thrombophlebitis)
- New fever after initial DVT treatment

**Actions**:
- **Urgent evaluation**: Blood cultures, imaging (chest X-ray, CT PE protocol)
- Consider broad-spectrum antibiotics if septic thrombophlebitis suspected
- Rule out alternative sources: cellulitis, urinary tract infection, pneumonia

#### Respiratory Changes (A3)

**PE Warning Signs**:
- **Sudden-onset dyspnea**: Classic PE presentation
- **Painful breathing** (pleuritic chest pain): Suggests pulmonary infarction
- **Extreme shortness of breath**: Massive PE with hemodynamic compromise

**PE Probability by Symptom Severity**:

| A3 Response | PE Risk | Action |
|-------------|---------|--------|
| No shortness of breath | Low | Continue monitoring |
| Some/Short of breath | **Moderate** | **Same-day evaluation**: D-dimer, CT PE protocol |
| Increased/Extreme SOB | **High** | **Urgent evaluation**: Rule out PE immediately |
| Painful breathing | **Moderate-High** | **Same-day evaluation**: Pleuritic pain suggests PE |

**Immediate Actions for Suspected PE**:
1. Check vital signs: Tachycardia (HR >100), hypoxia (SpO2 <92%), tachypnea (RR >20)
2. Obtain ECG (may show tachycardia, right heart strain)
3. D-dimer if not already anticoagulated
4. CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) - gold standard
5. If massive PE (hemodynamic instability): Emergency transfer, consider thrombolytics

#### Dizziness/Lightheadedness (A4)

**Interpretation**:
- **With respiratory symptoms** (A3): Possible PE with hypoxia/hypotension
- **Without respiratory symptoms**: May indicate:
  - Volume depletion
  - Anemia (from occult bleeding on anticoagulation)
  - Orthostatic hypotension

**Actions**:
- Check orthostatic vitals (lying → standing)
- Assess for anemia (CBC if on anticoagulation)
- If + respiratory symptoms → Evaluate for PE urgently

---

### Section B: Local DVT Progression

#### Pain (B1)

**Worsening pain interpretation**:
- **Moderate-Severe new pain**: May indicate:
  - **Clot extension** (propagation of thrombosis)
  - **Phlegmasia cerulea dolens** (massive DVT with venous occlusion) - rare but limb-threatening
  - **Post-thrombotic syndrome** (chronic complication)
  - **Superimposed cellulitis/infection**

**Clinical Assessment**:
- Inspect limb: Color (blue = phlegmasia), warmth (red = cellulitis), pulses
- Palpate calf: Homans sign (pain with dorsiflexion) - unreliable but classic
- Compare to unaffected limb

**Red Flags**:
- Severe unremitting pain despite anticoagulation
- Pain with limb discoloration (blue/purple)
- Absence of pulses distal to DVT

#### Swelling (B2)

**Worsening swelling interpretation**:
- **Acute worsening**: May indicate clot extension
- **Persistent/chronic swelling**: Post-thrombotic syndrome (>30 days)
- **Bilateral swelling**: Consider alternative diagnosis (CHF, renal failure, IVC thrombosis)

**Measurement**:
- Measure calf circumference: >2 cm difference from unaffected limb is significant
- Document progression: stable, improving, worsening

**Management**:
- **Worsening despite anticoagulation**: Consider ultrasound to assess clot burden
- **Compression therapy**: Graduated compression stockings (30-40 mmHg) once acute phase resolves
- **Elevation**: Elevate limb above heart level when resting

---

### Section C: Anticoagulation Safety

#### Medication Adherence (C1-C3)

**Non-adherence risks**:
- **DVT extension**: Clot propagates proximally
- **PE development**: ~50% of untreated proximal DVT develops PE
- **Recurrence**: DVT recurs in up to 30% if anticoagulation inadequate

**Common "Other" reasons for non-adherence** (C3):
- **Cost**: Connect to patient assistance, generic alternatives
- **Fear of bleeding**: Education on risk/benefit, INR monitoring reassurance
- **Forgot**: Pill reminders, simplify to once-daily if possible
- **Side effects**: Nausea, GI upset → Consider alternative anticoagulant

**Management of non-adherence**:
- Assess barriers immediately
- Reinforce importance of continuous anticoagulation
- Consider transitioning to long-acting injectable (if cost/adherence issue)

#### Bleeding Complications (C4-C5)

**Bruising (C4)**:
- **Mild bruising**: Common, acceptable on anticoagulation
- **Extensive/new bruising**: Check INR (if on warfarin) or anti-Xa level
- **Spontaneous bruising**: May indicate over-anticoagulation

**Bleeding Signs (C5)**:

| Finding | Significance | Action |
|---------|--------------|--------|
| **Blood in urine (hematuria)** | Gross hematuria on anticoagulation | **Urgent**: Hold anticoagulation, CBC, urology consult |
| **Blood in stool** | GI bleeding (melena or hematochezia) | **Urgent**: Hold anticoagulation, CBC, GI evaluation |
| **Dark stools (melena)** | Upper GI bleeding | **Urgent**: Stop anticoagulation, emergent endoscopy |
| **Prolonged bleeding from cuts** | Over-anticoagulation or platelet dysfunction | Check INR/anti-Xa, hold next dose, reassess |

**Major Bleeding Criteria** (any of these = major):
- Hemoglobin drop >2 g/dL
- Transfusion of ≥2 units RBCs
- Bleeding into critical site (intracranial, retroperitoneal)
- Fatal bleeding

**Management of Bleeding**:
- **Minor bleeding** (small bruises): Continue anticoagulation, monitor
- **Moderate bleeding** (C5 symptoms): Hold anticoagulation, check labs (CBC, PT/INR, aPTT), clinical evaluation
- **Major bleeding**: Stop anticoagulation, reversal agent (vitamin K for warfarin, idarucizumab for dabigatran, andexanet alfa for Xa inhibitors), emergent consultation

## Combined Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Scenario Combinations

| Symptom Pattern | Diagnosis Concern | Urgency |
|----------------|-------------------|---------|
| **A3: Increased SOB + A4: Dizzy + Tachycardia** | **Massive PE** | **IMMEDIATE (911)** |
| **A3: Painful breathing + A1: Fever** | PE with infarction OR septic embolus | **Urgent (<2 hours)** |
| **B1: Severe pain + B2: Severe swelling + Blue limb** | Phlegmasia cerulea dolens | **Urgent (<2 hours)** - vascular surgery |
| **C5: Yes (bleeding) + Hypotension** | **Major bleeding** | **IMMEDIATE (911)** |
| **A3: SOB + SpO2 <92%** | Likely PE | **Urgent** - CT PE protocol |

---

## Correlation with Objective Data

### Vital Signs to Monitor

| Vital | Threshold | PE Concern |
|-------|-----------|------------|
| **SpO2** | <92% | High PE probability |
| **Heart Rate** | >100 bpm | Moderate PE probability |
| **Respiratory Rate** | >20/min | Moderate PE probability |
| **Blood Pressure** | Systolic <90 | Massive PE with shock |

### Laboratory Monitoring

**For patients on anticoagulation**:
- **Warfarin**: INR goal 2-3 (check weekly initially, then monthly once stable)
- **Dabigatran/Rivaroxaban/Apixaban**: No routine monitoring, but check renal function
- **CBC**: Monitor hemoglobin for occult bleeding

**Clinical Note**: DVT patients are at continuous risk for PE until therapeutic anticoagulation is achieved (typically 24-48 hours after initiation). New respiratory symptoms should always prompt PE evaluation. Anticoagulation adherence is critical; even short gaps increase thrombotic risk significantly.
