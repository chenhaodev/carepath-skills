Monitor daily signs/symptoms (SpO2, RR, cough, wheezing, shortness of breath) to properly manage exacerbations. Target patients transitioning to home after acute in-patient COPD treatment, continuously engaging and monitoring for clinical deterioration.

## Duration
**30 days** post-discharge

---

## Eligibility Criteria

### Inclusion
- Patient with underlying COPD, discharged to home setting

---

## Daily Monitoring Protocol & Tasks

### Daily Tasks (Patient-Performed)
1. **Daily BP Measurements**
   - Monitor for steroid-induced HTN or medication side effects

2. **Medication Adherence Tracking**
   - **Maintenance inhaler**: LABA/LAMA (daily use, not PRN)
   - **Rescue inhaler**: SABA use frequency (increasing use = worsening control)
   - **Steroid course**: If prescribed post-discharge, complete full course
   - **Antibiotic course**: If prescribed, complete full course

3. **Daily Diary - Activity Tracking**
   - Steps/activity level (reduced activity may indicate worsening)
   - Dyspnea with activities of daily living

### Clinical Team Monitoring

#### Daily COPD Symptom Checker
See **[COPD Questionnaire - Daily Checker](../../shared/questionnaires/copd-questionnaire.md#1-daily-copd-symptom-checker)**
- Respiratory distress symptoms
- Mucus production (volume, color - yellow/green indicates infection)
- Chest tightness, wheezing
- Fever (bacterial infection indicator)
- Maintenance and rescue inhaler use tracking

#### Bi-Monthly COPD Assessment Test (CAT)
See **[COPD Questionnaire - CAT](../../shared/questionnaires/copd-questionnaire.md#2-copd-assessment-test-cat)**
- Administer Day 0, Day 14, Day 30
- Track score changes (≥3 point change clinically significant)
- CAT ≥20 = high impact, consider therapy escalation

#### Optional PHQ-9 (at program initiation)
- Depression screening (common COPD comorbidity)

---

## Alert Thresholds & Escalations

See **[Universal Alert Thresholds](../../shared/alert-thresholds.md)** and **[COPD Comorbidities](../../shared/comorbidity-matrix.md#copd--chf)**.

### COPD-Specific Post-Acute Alerts

| Parameter | Threshold | Action |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| **SpO2** | <88-90% (below patient's baseline) | **Same-day evaluation**: Assess for exacerbation, increase O2, consider steroids/antibiotics |
| **Respiration Rate** | >24 breaths/min | **Clinical call**: Assess dyspnea, inhaler technique, exacerbation signs |
| **CAT Score** | ≥3 point increase from baseline | **Clinical evaluation**: Medication optimization, pulmonary rehab referral |
| **Purulent Sputum** | New yellow/green sputum | **Same-day**: Consider antibiotics (meets Anthonisen criteria if + dyspnea/volume) |
| **Increasing Rescue Inhaler Use** | >4-6 puffs/day | **Clinical call**: Inadequate control, consider adding LABA/LAMA or steroid burst |

---

## Complications & Adverse Events to Monitor

### Increased Shortness of Breath and Respiratory Distress (ARDS)
- **Signs**: Worsening dyspnea, increasing O2 requirement, hypoxemia
- **Action**: Assess for exacerbation vs pneumonia vs PE, consider hospital readmission

### Activity Limitations
- **Concern**: Functional decline, fear avoidance of activity
- **Action**: Pulmonary rehabilitation referral, gradual activity increase

### Secondary Pneumonia
- **Signs**: Fever, productive cough, new infiltrate on chest X-ray
- **Action**: Antibiotics, consider hospitalization if severe

### Depression
- **Concern**: Common in COPD (40% prevalence), worsens outcomes
- **Action**: PHQ-9 screening, psychiatric/psychology referral, antidepressants

### Pulmonary Hypertension, Heart Failure
- **Concern**: Chronic hypoxia causes pulmonary HTN → right heart failure (cor pulmonale)
- **Action**: Echo assessment, optimize O2 therapy, cardiology referral

---

## COPD Management Optimization

### Inhaler Therapy

#### Maintenance Therapy (Daily, Not PRN)
- **LABA** (long-acting beta-agonist): Formoterol, salmeterol
- **LAMA** (long-acting muscarinic antagonist): Tiotropium, umeclidinium
- **LABA/LAMA combination**: Preferred for most COPD patients (Anoro, Bevespi, Stiolto)
- **ICS/LABA** (if frequent exacerbations or asthma-COPD overlap): Advair, Symbicort, Breo

#### Rescue Therapy (PRN)
- **SABA** (short-acting beta-agonist): Albuterol
- **Frequency monitoring**: >2 puffs/day indicates inadequate control

#### Inhaler Technique Education
- **Critical**: 70% of patients use inhalers incorrectly
- **Assessment**: Observe technique via video visit
- **Spacer use**: Improves drug delivery for MDIs
- **Nebulizer**: Alternative if unable to use MDIs properly

### Oxygen Therapy
- **Indications**: SpO2 <88% at rest OR SpO2 <88% with exertion
- **Goal**: Maintain SpO2 88-92% (avoid over-oxygenation - CO2 retention risk)
- **Duration**: Continuous (>15 hrs/day) OR nocturnal OR with exertion
- **Benefits**: Reduces mortality if used ≥15 hrs/day in hypoxemic patients

### Pulmonary Rehabilitation
- **Components**: Exercise training, education, nutritional counseling, psychosocial support
- **Benefits**: Improves dyspnea, exercise capacity, quality of life, reduces hospitalizations
- **Referral**: All COPD patients post-exacerbation should be referred
- **Timing**: Ideally within 4 weeks of discharge

### Smoking Cessation
- **Critical**: Only intervention that slows FEV1 decline
- **Approach**: Counseling + pharmacotherapy (varenicline, bupropion, NRT)
- **Referral**: Tobacco quitline, smoking cessation programs

### Vaccinations
- **Influenza vaccine**: Annually
- **Pneumococcal vaccine**: PPSV23 and PCV13 (per guidelines)
- **COVID-19 vaccine**: Reduce severe disease risk
- **Tdap**: If not up to date

## Patient Education Content

### COPD Education Topics (Via Patient App)
- What is COPD? (pathophysiology in lay terms)
- Inhaler technique (videos, demonstrations)
- Recognizing exacerbation warning signs (dyspnea worsening, sputum color change)
- When to call your care team
- Oxygen safety (no smoking near O2, proper storage)
- Energy conservation techniques
- Breathing exercises (pursed-lip breathing, diaphragmatic breathing)
- Smoking cessation resources

---

## Care Coordination & Escalation

### Daily Care Team Monitoring
- Patient questionnaire responses (dyspnea, sputum, rescue inhaler use)
- Care plan adherence (medications, activity)
- Alerts and physiologic parameters (SpO2 trends, RR, activity levels)

### Comorbidity Monitoring and Management
- **COPD + Diabetes**: Steroid courses worsen glucose - coordinate with diabetes management
- **COPD + HTN**: Monitor BP (steroids and beta-agonists increase BP)
- **COPD + CHF**: Differentiate dyspnea cause (wheezes vs crackles, BNP helpful)

### Support and Intervention
- **Chat/Video**: Inhaler technique review, symptom assessment, medication adherence
- **Escalation**: Same-day clinical calls for exacerbation signs

### Transition Back to Acute Care
**Criteria for Re-escalation**: See **[Transition from Post-Acute](./transition-from-acute.md)**
- Worsening hypoxemia (SpO2 <88% despite O2 increase)
- Increasing dyspnea, respiratory rate >30
- Fever + worsening respiratory symptoms
- Inability to manage at home
- **Action**: Transition to `carepath-acute` skill for intensive management

---

## Other Recommended Care

### Follow-Up Appointments
- **Pulmonology**: Within 2-4 weeks post-discharge
- **PCP**: Within 30 days
- **Pulmonary Rehabilitation**: Referral within 4 weeks

### Labs
- **Follow-up labs**: If prescribed post-discharge (CBC if on antibiotics, etc.)
- **Follow-up Chest X-ray**: If prescribed (assess infiltrate resolution)
- **FSBS Q6hrs**: If diabetic (especially during steroid courses)
