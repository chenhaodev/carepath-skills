## Devices & Monitoring Equipment

See **[Devices Reference](../../shared/devices.md)** for complete specifications.

### Required Devices
- **Connected BP Cuff** (Welch Allyn 1700)
  - **CRITICAL**: BP monitoring is cornerstone of HTN management

---

## Daily Monitoring Protocol & Tasks

### Daily Tasks (Patient-Performed)

1. **Twice Daily BP Measurements**
   - **Morning** (before medications) and **Evening**
   - Proper technique:
     - Seated, feet flat on floor, back supported
     - Arm at heart level
     - 5 min rest before measurement
     - Avoid caffeine/smoking 30 min before

2. **Dietary (Salt, etc.) Intake Tracking**
   - Sodium goal: <2000mg/day (<1500mg if resistant HTN)
   - Track high-sodium foods consumed

3. **Medication Adherence Tracking**
   - Record all antihypertensive medications taken
   - Goal: >80% adherence

### Clinical Team Monitoring

#### Daily HTN Symptom Checker
See **[HTN Questionnaire](../../shared/questionnaires/htn-questionnaire.md)**
- Assessment for symptoms of severe hypertension:
  - Headache, chest pain, shortness of breath
  - Dizziness, cognitive impairment, visual abnormalities
- Assessment for hypotension (over-treatment):
  - Dizziness, lightheadedness

---

## Alert Thresholds & Escalations

See **[Universal Alert Thresholds](../../shared/alert-thresholds.md)** and **[HTN Comorbidities](../../shared/comorbidity-matrix.md#diabetes--hypertension)**.

### HTN-Specific Post-Acute Alerts

| BP Reading | Interpretation | Action |
|------------|----------------|--------|
| **SBP ≥180 or DBP ≥110** + symptoms | Hypertensive urgency | **Urgent (same-day)**: Medication adjustment, close monitoring |
| **SBP ≥180/120** + end-organ symptoms | **HYPERTENSIVE EMERGENCY** | **CALL 911**: Hospital transfer |
| **SBP <90** + symptoms | Symptomatic hypotension | **Hold antihypertensives**, assess volume, clinical call |
| **SBP 140-179** consistently | Uncontrolled HTN | **Within week**: Medication optimization |
| **SBP <130** consistently | Goal achieved | Continue current regimen |

---

## Complications & Adverse Events to Monitor

### Headaches / Nose Bleed
- **Concern**: Severe HTN (headache) or anticoagulation if on aspirin (nosebleed)
- **Action**: Check BP, assess severity

### Pulmonary Edema / Heart Failure
- **Concern**: Hypertensive heart disease progressing to CHF
- **Action**: **Urgent evaluation** - weight, dyspnea assessment, BNP, echo

### Chest Pain / Myocardial Infarction
- **Concern**: HTN is major CAD risk factor; acute hypertension can precipitate ACS
- **Action**: **Emergency evaluation** - ECG, troponin

### TIA / Stroke
- **Concern**: HTN is #1 modifiable stroke risk factor
- **Action**: **CALL 911** - sudden weakness, speech changes, facial droop, vision changes

### Aortic Dissection
- **Concern**: Rare but catastrophic; sudden severe chest/back pain
- **Action**: **CALL 911** - requires emergency imaging and surgery

---

## GDMT (Guideline-Directed Medical Therapy)

### BP Goal Targets
- **General population**: <140/90 mmHg
- **Diabetes or CKD**: <130/80 mmHg
- **Elderly (>65)**: <130 systolic (but avoid <120 - increased fall risk)

### First-Line Antihypertensives

#### ACE Inhibitors or ARBs
- **Examples**: Lisinopril, enalapril (ACE-I); Losartan, valsartan (ARB)
- **Benefits**: First-line, especially with diabetes/CKD (renal protective)
- **Monitoring**: BMP (K, Cr), dry cough (ACE-I side effect - switch to ARB)

#### Calcium Channel Blockers
- **Examples**: Amlodipine, nifedipine (dihydropyridine)
- **Benefits**: Effective, well-tolerated
- **Side Effects**: Peripheral edema (ankles), constipation

#### Thiazide Diuretics
- **Examples**: Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), chlorthalidone
- **Benefits**: Inexpensive, effective
- **Monitoring**: BMP (K - risk of hypokalemia), glucose (may worsen diabetes)

### Combination Therapy (Most Patients Require 2-3 Agents)
- **ACE-I/ARB + Thiazide diuretic** (synergistic)
- **ACE-I/ARB + Calcium channel blocker**
- **Triple therapy**: ACE-I/ARB + CCB + Thiazide

### Medication Adherence Strategies
- **Simplify regimen**: Combine into single-pill combinations if possible
- **Once-daily dosing**: Improves adherence vs multiple daily doses
- **Address barriers**: Cost (generics, patient assistance), side effects (switch agents)

---

## Patient Education Content

### HTN Education Topics (Via Patient App)
- What is hypertension? ("silent killer" - no symptoms until complications)
- Why BP control matters (prevent stroke, MI, CHF, kidney disease)
- **Dietary recommendations**:
  - Low sodium (<2000mg/day)
  - DASH diet (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension)
  - Limit alcohol
- **Lifestyle and exercise recommendations**:
  - Regular aerobic exercise (30 min most days)
  - Weight loss if overweight (10 lb loss = 5-20 mmHg SBP reduction)
  - Stress management
- Home BP monitoring technique
- Medication importance (even when feeling fine)

---

## Care Coordination & Escalation

### Daily Care Team Monitoring
- Patient questionnaire responses (symptoms, medication adherence)
- Care plan adherence (BP measurements, dietary tracking)
- Alerts and physiologic parameters (BP trends)

### Comorbidity Monitoring and Management
- **HTN + Diabetes**: Monitor glucose (thiazides worsen hyperglycemia); ACE-I/ARB first-line for both
- **HTN + Hyperlipidemia**: Statin therapy for ASCVD risk reduction

### Support and Intervention
- **Chat/Video**: Medication education, lifestyle counseling, BP measurement technique
- **Escalation**: Same-day clinical calls for hypertensive urgency or severe hypotension

---

## Other Recommended Care

### Follow-Up Appointments
- **PCP or Cardiology**: Within 1-2 weeks post-discharge for BP check, medication adjustment
- **Cardiology referral**: If resistant HTN (≥3 agents including diuretic), secondary HTN suspected

### Labs
- **Monitor labs**: Renal panel (BMP), Urinalysis, Lipid panel, CBC (as prescribed)
  - **Timing**: Week 1-2 after medication changes (check K and Cr)
  - **Frequency**: Every 3-6 months once stable

### Cardiac, Ophthalmology Referrals (If Needed, Per PCP Assessment)
- **Echo**: Assess for LV hypertrophy, diastolic dysfunction (hypertensive heart disease)
- **Ophthalmology**: Hypertensive retinopathy screening (especially if diabetes coexists)
- **Renal ultrasound**: If suspected renal artery stenosis (secondary HTN)

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Measurement |

| **BP at goal** | SBP <130 (or individualized target) | Twice daily BP measurements |
| **No HTN-related ER visits** | Primary goal | Track ED visits |
| **Medication adherence** | >80% | Daily tracking |
| **Lifestyle modifications** | Sodium <2000mg/day, exercise 3+ days/week | Self-reported tracking |
