# Transition from Acute Care: Post-Acute Team Intake Protocol

## Overview

This protocol defines the **post-acute care team's** responsibilities and procedures for receiving patients transitioning from the **Acute Care Pathway**. It complements the acute care team's discharge protocol documented in [`carepath-acute/references/transition-to-postacute.md`](../../carepath-acute/references/transition-to-postacute.md).

**Key Principle**: Smooth handoff ensures continuity of care, prevents gaps in monitoring, and maintains patient safety during the critical transition period.

---

## Post-Acute Team Roles & Responsibilities

### Care Team Structure

**Post-Acute Care Team** (may differ from acute care team):

1. **Clinical Lead** (Physician or NP/PA):
   - Reviews handoff note from acute care team
   - Approves post-acute monitoring plan
   - Available for complex clinical decisions, medication adjustments
   - Conducts initial post-transition video visit (within 3-5 days)

2. **Care Coordinator / Nurse Navigator**:
   - Primary point of contact for patient
   - Reviews daily monitoring data (every 2-3 days routine, or when alerts trigger)
   - Triages alerts (critical → immediate physician notification, urgent → same-day outreach, advisory → routine follow-up)
   - Coordinates follow-up appointments, lab work, DME

3. **Pharmacist** (optional, for complex medication regimens):
   - Reviews medication reconciliation
   - Identifies drug interactions, adherence barriers
   - Medication education and counseling

4. **Device Support Specialist**:
   - Troubleshoots device issues (connectivity, malfunction, user error)
   - Arranges device replacement if needed
   - Monitors device compliance (alerts if patient not using devices)

---

## Intake Process (Step-by-Step)

### Step 1: Receive Handoff from Acute Care Team

**Timeline**: Within 24 hours of patient transition to post-acute care

**Post-acute clinical lead or care coordinator reviews**:

1. **Handoff note** (provided by acute care team):
   - Primary diagnosis and acute care summary
   - Duration of acute care (X days)
   - Treatments provided (IV medications, procedures)
   - Complications encountered
   - Peak severity (worst vital signs, lab values)
   - Current clinical status (vital signs, labs, symptom resolution)
   - Medication changes (IV → oral conversions, new meds, dose adjustments)
   - Comorbidities
   - Post-acute monitoring plan (duration, key parameters)

2. **Electronic medical record (EMR) review**:
   - Verify handoff note matches EMR documentation
   - Check for any recent ED visits, hospitalizations, or care gaps
   - Review historical data (prior admissions, baseline vitals, medication adherence history)

3. **Monitoring platform review**:
   - Access patient's monitoring dashboard
   - Verify device connectivity (data transmitting from Everion armband, weight scale, BP cuff, etc.)
   - Review recent trends (weight, BP, SpO2, glucose, etc.)
   - Confirm alert thresholds configured correctly for post-acute phase

4. **Flag high-risk patients**:
   - Multiple comorbidities (e.g., CHF + COPD + diabetes)
   - History of frequent readmissions (≥2 admissions in past 6 months)
   - Social factors (non-adherence, housing instability, limited caregiver support)
   - Complex medication regimen (≥10 medications)
   - Early post-acute transition (<3 days from acute care start - may indicate premature discharge)

**Action**: Document handoff receipt in EMR, acknowledge receipt to acute care team

---

### Step 2: Initial Patient Contact (Within 24-48 Hours)

**Purpose**: Establish rapport, verify patient understanding, address immediate concerns

**Care coordinator calls patient**:

1. **Introduction**:
   - "Hi [Patient Name], this is [Name] from the post-acute care team. You just completed your hospital-at-home care for [CHF/COPD/Pneumonia/etc.], and I'll be your main contact for the next [30/90/14] days."
   - Explain care team change (if different personnel than acute care)

2. **Verify understanding of transition**:
   - "Do you understand why you're continuing with home monitoring?"
   - "What questions do you have about your daily tasks or medications?"

3. **Review daily tasks** (quick reminder):
   - Daily questionnaire (symptom assessment)
   - Vital checks (weight, BP, temperature, SpO2, glucose - depending on disease)
   - Medication logging
   - Device usage (Everion armband worn ~22 hours/day, charged nightly)

4. **Device functionality check**:
   - "Is your [Everion armband/weight scale/BP cuff/glucometer] working properly?"
   - "Are you seeing your data upload to the app?"
   - Troubleshoot any issues immediately (or schedule device support call)

5. **Medication review**:
   - "Do you have all your medications picked up from the pharmacy?"
   - "Any questions about how to take them or side effects?"
   - Address barriers (cost, transportation to pharmacy, confusion about dosing)

6. **Follow-up appointments**:
   - Confirm PCP appointment scheduled (within 7-14 days)
   - Confirm specialist appointment if applicable (cardiology, pulmonology, etc.)
   - Remind about any pending lab work (INR for warfarin, electrolytes for diuretics, etc.)

7. **Emergency contact information**:
   - Provide 24/7 nurse hotline number
   - Review when to call care team vs 911
   - "If you have [weight gain ≥3 lbs/fever >38°C/chest pain/etc.], call us immediately. If you have [severe chest pain/difficulty breathing/confusion], call 911."

8. **Schedule first video visit**:
   - Typically 3-5 days after transition
   - Earlier if high-risk patient or concerns identified

**Documentation**: Log initial contact in EMR, note any concerns or action items

---

### Step 3: Review Medication Reconciliation

**Timeline**: Within 24 hours of transition (pharmacist or clinical lead)

**Medication reconciliation checklist**:

1. **IV → Oral conversions verified**:
   - CHF: IV furosemide → oral furosemide (dose typically 1.5-2x IV dose)
   - Pneumonia: IV ceftriaxone → oral levofloxacin or amoxicillin-clavulanate
   - Diabetes: IV insulin → subcutaneous basal-bolus insulin
   - HTN: IV labetalol → oral metoprolol or labetalol
   - DVT: IV heparin → oral warfarin or DOAC

2. **New medications**:
   - Purpose documented (patient understands why taking)
   - Dosing schedule clear (once daily, BID, TID, etc.)
   - Side effects to watch for (e.g., ACE inhibitor → cough, diuretic → dizziness)

3. **Drug interactions identified**:
   - Warfarin + NSAIDs (bleeding risk)
   - Diuretics + ACE inhibitors (hyperkalemia risk if on potassium-sparing diuretics)
   - Beta-blockers + calcium channel blockers (bradycardia, hypotension risk)
   - Corticosteroids + diabetes medications (hyperglycemia)

4. **Adherence barriers assessed**:
   - Cost (patient can afford medications? Need generic alternatives, patient assistance programs?)
   - Complexity (≥10 medications → recommend pill organizer, simplify regimen if possible)
   - Health literacy (patient understands medication purposes? Need simplified instructions?)
   - Physical limitations (difficulty opening bottles → need easy-open caps, arthritis, vision issues)

5. **Refill plan established**:
   - Auto-refill enrolled (if available)
   - Pharmacy delivery arranged (if transportation barrier)
   - Next refill due date noted (alert if patient hasn't refilled by due date)

**Action**: Document medication review complete, address any identified barriers (contact pharmacy for generic substitution, arrange patient assistance application, etc.)

---

### Step 4: Device Setup Verification

**Timeline**: Within 48 hours of transition (device support specialist or care coordinator)

**Device verification checklist**:

1. **All required devices deployed** (disease-specific):
   - CHF: Everion armband ✓, weight scale ✓, BP cuff ✓, pulse oximeter ✓
   - COPD: Everion armband ✓, pulse oximeter ✓, BP cuff ✓, spirometer (optional) ✓
   - Pneumonia: Everion armband ✓, pulse oximeter ✓, thermometer ✓
   - HTN: BP cuff ✓, Everion armband (optional) ✓
   - Diabetes: CGM or glucometer ✓, ketone meter ✓, Everion armband (optional) ✓
   - DVT: INR monitor (if warfarin) ✓, Everion armband ✓, pulse oximeter ✓
   - COVID: Everion armband ✓, thermometer ✓

2. **Device connectivity confirmed**:
   - Check monitoring platform - data transmitting in real-time?
   - Review past 24-48 hours of data - any gaps?
   - If gaps → Troubleshoot (Bluetooth connection, app permissions, device charged, etc.)

3. **Patient proficiency verified**:
   - Ask patient to demonstrate device use (via video call or in-person if home health visit)
   - CHF: "Can you show me how you weigh yourself each morning?"
   - HTN: "Can you show me how you take your blood pressure?"
   - Diabetes: "Can you show me how you check your glucose and log it in the app?"
   - Correct any errors in technique (improper cuff placement, not zeroing scale, etc.)

4. **Backup plan if device malfunction**:
   - Manual logging instructions provided (paper log if device fails)
   - Device replacement process explained ("Call this number, we'll mail new device within 24 hours")
   - Patient has backup device if critical (e.g., backup glucometer for diabetes)

**Action**: Document device verification complete. If issues identified, escalate to device support team for replacement or technical troubleshooting.

---

### Step 5: Alert Threshold Configuration

**Timeline**: Within 24 hours of transition (clinical lead or care coordinator)

**Alert configuration checklist**:

1. **Disease-specific thresholds set** (reference [`shared/alert-thresholds.md`](../../shared/alert-thresholds.md)):
   - CHF: Weight gain ≥3 lbs/3 days (critical), SpO2 <92% (critical), KCCQ drop ≥10 points (urgent)
   - COPD: SpO2 <88% (critical), CAT score ≥20 (urgent), increased purulent sputum (urgent)
   - Pneumonia: Fever >38°C (urgent), SpO2 <92% (critical), new/worsening dyspnea (urgent)
   - HTN: SBP >160 or DBP >100 mmHg sustained (urgent), end-organ symptoms (critical)
   - Diabetes: Glucose <70 or >250 mg/dL (critical), ketones >0.6 mmol/L (urgent)
   - DVT: New chest pain/dyspnea (critical - PE concern), major bleeding (critical), INR >4.0 or <2.0 (urgent)
   - COVID: SpO2 <92% (critical), emergency symptoms (critical - 911), fever >39°C (urgent)

2. **Adjust for patient's baseline**:
   - COPD patient with baseline SpO2 90% on 2L NC → Alert if SpO2 <88% (not <92%)
   - CHF patient with baseline weight 180 lbs → Alert if weight >183 lbs (3-lb gain from baseline)
   - HTN patient with baseline BP 140/85 → Alert if BP >160/100 (controlled but not perfect baseline)

3. **Trending alerts configured**:
   - Weight trend (CHF): ≥1 lb/day for 3 consecutive days = advisory alert (early warning)
   - Glucose trend (Diabetes): Increasing glucose over 3 days despite same insulin dose = urgent alert
   - SpO2 trend: Drop ≥3% over 24 hours (even if still >94%) = advisory alert

4. **Non-compliance alerts**:
   - Missed questionnaire >24 hours → Advisory alert (care team outreach to patient)
   - Device not transmitting data >6 hours → Device alert (technical support troubleshooting)
   - Medication adherence <80% (based on app logging) → Urgent alert (adherence intervention)

5. **Alert routing**:
   - **Critical alerts** → Immediate notification to clinical lead + care coordinator (phone call, page, SMS)
   - **Urgent alerts** → Care coordinator notification (email, app notification) - response within 24 hours
   - **Advisory alerts** → Daily summary to care team - addressed during routine review

**Action**: Test alert system (send test alert, verify care team receives notification). Document alert thresholds configured in EMR.

---

### Step 6: Initial Care Plan Development

**Timeline**: Within 72 hours of transition (clinical lead)

**Post-acute care plan includes**:

1. **Monitoring duration**:
   - CHF: 30 days from acute care discharge
   - COPD: 90 days from exacerbation
   - Pneumonia: 30 days from discharge
   - HTN: 30 days from hypertensive urgency resolution
   - Diabetes: 30 days from DKA/HHS resolution
   - DVT: 90 days (minimum anticoagulation duration)
   - COVID: 14 days from diagnosis (adjust if transitioned mid-illness)

2. **Key monitoring parameters** (disease-specific):
   - CHF: Daily weight (MOST IMPORTANT), daily symptoms (orthopnea, PND, edema), weekly KCCQ-12
   - COPD: Daily symptoms (dyspnea, sputum), weekly CAT score, SpO2 trends, inhaler adherence
   - Pneumonia: Twice daily temperature, daily respiratory symptoms, SpO2, antibiotic completion
   - HTN: Twice daily BP (initially), daily eventually, medication adherence, side effects
   - Diabetes: QID glucose (or CGM trends), daily ketone check if glucose >250, insulin logging
   - DVT: Weekly INR (if warfarin), daily PE symptom screening, bleeding surveillance, anticoagulation adherence
   - COVID: Twice daily temperature, daily symptom questionnaire, SpO2 trends, day 14 long COVID screening

3. **Follow-up appointments scheduled**:
   - PCP: Within 7-14 days
   - Specialist (if applicable):
     - CHF → Cardiology within 2-4 weeks (GDMT optimization)
     - COPD → Pulmonology within 4 weeks, pulmonary rehab referral
     - Pneumonia → PCP follow-up CXR at 6 weeks (confirm resolution)
     - HTN → PCP within 2-4 weeks (continued BP monitoring)
     - Diabetes → Endocrinology within 2-4 weeks (A1c check, insulin adjustment)
     - DVT → Hematology within 4 weeks (anticoagulation duration decision)
     - COVID → PCP within 2 weeks, long COVID clinic if symptoms persist >4 weeks

4. **Anticipated challenges addressed**:
   - High-risk comorbidities → Lower threshold for escalation, more frequent check-ins
   - Medication non-adherence history → Pill organizer, adherence app, pharmacy coordination
   - Social factors → Social work referral, transportation assistance, meal delivery, etc.
   - Health literacy concerns → Simplified education materials, teach-back method, caregiver involvement

5. **Goals for post-acute period**:
   - Avoid readmission (primary goal)
   - Optimize medications (GDMT for CHF, inhaler technique for COPD, glucose control for diabetes)
   - Patient education (self-management skills, warning sign recognition)
   - Smooth transition to long-term primary care management

**Action**: Document post-acute care plan in EMR, share with patient during first video visit.

---

### Step 7: First Video Visit (Within 3-5 Days of Transition)

**Purpose**: Comprehensive clinical assessment, address questions, reinforce education, build rapport

**Clinical lead conducts video visit**:

1. **Clinical assessment**:
   - Review of systems (disease-specific symptoms)
   - CHF: "Any shortness of breath? Swelling in your legs? Trouble sleeping flat?"
   - COPD: "How's your breathing compared to when you left acute care? Any wheezing? Cough?"
   - Pneumonia: "Any fever? Cough? Chest pain?"
   - HTN: "Any headaches, vision changes, chest pain?"
   - Diabetes: "Any symptoms of low blood sugar? High blood sugar?"
   - DVT: "Any leg swelling or pain? Any chest pain or shortness of breath?"
   - COVID: "How are you feeling overall? Any return of symptoms?"

2. **Review monitoring data trends**:
   - Show patient their data graphs (weight trend, BP trend, glucose trend, etc.)
   - "Look, your weight is stable - that's great. We want to catch any changes early."
   - "Your blood pressure is coming down nicely on the new medication."
   - Identify any concerning trends (even if not yet triggering alerts)

3. **Medication review**:
   - "Are you taking all your medications as prescribed?"
   - "Any side effects bothering you?" (cough from ACE inhibitor, dizziness from diuretic, etc.)
   - "Do you understand what each medication is for?"
   - Address adherence barriers identified (cost, complexity, side effects)

4. **Device troubleshooting**:
   - "Are the devices working well for you?"
   - "Any problems with the app or uploading data?"
   - Observe patient demonstrating technique (weigh-in, BP check, glucose check) via video

5. **Patient education**:
   - Review warning signs (when to call care team vs 911)
   - Disease-specific education (sodium restriction for CHF, inhaler technique for COPD, sick day management for diabetes)
   - Answer questions

6. **Set expectations for post-acute monitoring**:
   - "I'll be reviewing your data every 2-3 days. If we see any concerning changes, I'll reach out to you."
   - "You'll have another video visit with me in 2 weeks, then again before you complete the program."
   - "If you have any questions or concerns before then, call the nurse hotline anytime."

7. **Assess psychosocial factors**:
   - "How are you coping with all this?"
   - Screen for depression, anxiety (illness-related stress, fear of readmission)
   - Assess social support ("Is there someone helping you at home?")
   - Refer to social work, mental health, or chaplaincy if needed

**Documentation**: Video visit note in EMR (assessment, plan, patient education provided, next visit scheduled).

## Ongoing Post-Acute Care (Routine Monitoring)

### Routine Data Review Schedule

**Care coordinator reviews monitoring data**:

- **Every 2-3 days** (routine)
- **Daily** if high-risk patient (multiple comorbidities, recent alerts, non-adherence)
- **Immediately** if critical or urgent alert triggered

**Review checklist** (each review):

1. **Task compliance**:
   - Questionnaires completed daily? (If missing, outreach to patient)
   - Vital checks performed? (Weight daily for CHF, BP daily for HTN, glucose QID for diabetes, etc.)
   - Medication logging up to date?

2. **Vital sign trends** (disease-specific):
   - CHF: Weight trend (stable, increasing, decreasing?), SpO2 trend
   - COPD: SpO2 trend (stable at baseline 88-92%?), RR trend
   - Pneumonia: Temperature trend (afebrile?), SpO2 trend
   - HTN: BP trend (controlled <130/80?), HR trend
   - Diabetes: Glucose trend (time in range 70-180 mg/dL?), hypoglycemia episodes?
   - DVT: HR/SpO2 trend (PE surveillance), INR trend (if warfarin)
   - COVID: Temperature trend (afebrile?), SpO2 trend, activity level

3. **Symptom trends** (questionnaire responses):
   - CHF: KCCQ-12 score stable? Worsening orthopnea, edema, dyspnea?
   - COPD: CAT score stable? Increased dyspnea, sputum production?
   - Pneumonia: Resolution of cough, fever, chest pain?
   - HTN: Any end-organ damage symptoms (headache, vision changes)?
   - Diabetes: Hypo/hyperglycemia symptoms?
   - DVT: Any PE symptoms (chest pain, dyspnea)? Bleeding?
   - COVID: Symptom resolution? New symptoms (long COVID)?

4. **Alerts triggered**:
   - Critical alerts → Immediate response (call patient, assess urgency, escalate to physician, possible ER referral)
   - Urgent alerts → Outreach within 24 hours (phone call or video visit, intervention needed - medication adjustment, closer monitoring)
   - Advisory alerts → Addressed during routine review (patient education, reminder, device troubleshooting)

5. **Action items**:
   - Medication adjustments needed? (diuretic increase for weight gain, insulin adjustment for hyperglycemia, BP med titration)
   - Follow-up appointments confirmed? (PCP, specialist, labs)
   - Barriers identified? (medication non-adherence, device issues, psychosocial concerns)

**Documentation**: Brief data review note every 2-3 days (or daily if high-risk). More detailed note if intervention required.

---

### Video Visit Schedule

**Post-acute video visit schedule** (typical):

| Timing | Purpose | Conducted By |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| **Day 3-5 post-transition** | Initial comprehensive assessment, build rapport, address questions | Clinical Lead (Physician/NP/PA) |
| **Day 14-17** | Mid-point check-in, review progress, adjust plan if needed | Clinical Lead or Care Coordinator |
| **Day 25-28** (if 30-day program) | Final visit before completion, transition to primary care preparation | Clinical Lead |
| **As needed** | Urgent clinical concerns, medication adjustments, escalation prevention | Clinical Lead |

**Additional visits if**:
- Critical or frequent urgent alerts
- Medication non-adherence requiring intervention
- Psychosocial concerns (depression, anxiety, caregiver burnout)

---

## Alert Response Protocols

### Critical Alerts (Immediate Response <1 Hour)

**Examples**:
- CHF: Weight gain ≥5 lbs/week, SpO2 <92%
- COPD: SpO2 <88%, severe dyspnea
- Pneumonia: Fever >39°C, SpO2 <92%
- HTN: SBP >180 mmHg with symptoms, end-organ damage symptoms
- Diabetes: Glucose <70 mg/dL (hypoglycemia), glucose >400 mg/dL
- DVT: New chest pain/dyspnea (PE), major bleeding
- COVID: SpO2 <92%, emergency symptoms (blue lips, severe chest pain, confusion)

**Response**:
1. **Immediate physician notification** (page, phone call)
2. **Call patient immediately**:
   - Assess current status ("How are you feeling RIGHT NOW?")
   - Verify alert (device malfunction vs real clinical deterioration)
   - If real deterioration → Urgent intervention needed
3. **Decision**:
   - **Emergency (911)**: Severe symptoms, life-threatening (call 911, stay on phone with patient until EMS arrives)
   - **Urgent ED evaluation**: Moderate-severe symptoms, needs urgent assessment (arrange ED transport, notify ED of incoming patient)
   - **Urgent video visit**: Mild-moderate symptoms, may be manageable outpatient (conduct video visit within 1 hour, assess, decide)
   - **Medication adjustment + close monitoring**: Mild symptoms, early intervention (increase diuretic, add insulin, etc., follow-up call in 4-6 hours)
4. **Document**: Critical alert response, patient assessment, intervention, outcome

**Example (CHF critical alert)**:
- **Alert**: Weight gain 6 lbs in past week, patient reports increased dyspnea
- **Response**: Call patient immediately → Confirms worsening shortness of breath, orthopnea (now sleeping on 3 pillows, was 1 pillow)
- **Assessment**: Early decompensation (fluid overload)
- **Intervention**: Increase furosemide from 40 mg BID to 60 mg BID x 3 days, video visit tomorrow, daily weight check-ins
- **Outcome**: Weight down 4 lbs in 3 days, dyspnea improved → Readmission prevented

---

### Urgent Alerts (Response Within 24 Hours)

**Examples**:
- CHF: Weight gain 3-4 lbs/3 days, KCCQ score drop ≥10 points
- COPD: CAT score ≥20, increased purulent sputum
- Pneumonia: Fever 38-39°C, worsening cough
- HTN: SBP 160-179 mmHg sustained (without symptoms)
- Diabetes: Glucose 250-400 mg/dL, ketones 0.6-1.5 mmol/L
- DVT: INR 4.0-5.0 (if warfarin), minor bleeding
- COVID: Fever 38.5-39°C, worsening dyspnea (not severe)

**Response**:
1. **Care coordinator outreach** (within 24 hours):
   - Phone call or video visit
   - Assess symptoms, verify alert
   - Review medication adherence ("Did you take your medications as prescribed?")
   - Identify trigger (dietary indiscretion for CHF, missed inhaler dose for COPD, infection for diabetes, etc.)
2. **Intervention**:
   - Patient education (sodium restriction reminder, inhaler technique review, etc.)
   - Medication adjustment (if indicated - may require physician approval)
   - Increase monitoring frequency (daily check-ins for 3-5 days)
   - Schedule video visit if needed (within 2-3 days)
3. **Escalate to clinical lead if**:
   - Symptoms worsening despite intervention
   - Medication adjustment needed beyond care coordinator scope
   - Patient has multiple urgent alerts in short timeframe
4. **Document**: Urgent alert response, patient contact, intervention, follow-up plan

---

### Advisory Alerts (Response Within 2-3 Days)

   - "We noticed your weight is up a bit - remember to stick to your sodium restriction and fluid limit"
   - "Your blood sugar has been running a bit high - let's review your carb counting and insulin doses"
3. **Monitor trend**:
   - If improving → No further action
   - If worsening or persisting → Upgrade to urgent alert, more active intervention
4. **Document**: Advisory alert noted, patient education provided, trend monitoring

---

## Special Situations

### Situation 1: Patient Non-Compliance (Missed Tasks, Device Non-Use)

**Red flags**:
- Missed questionnaires >24 hours
- Weight not checked daily (CHF)
- BP not checked (HTN)
- Glucose checks incomplete (Diabetes)
- Device not transmitting data >6 hours

**Response**:
1. **Outreach to patient** (within 24 hours of non-compliance detected):
   - "Hi [Name], I noticed you haven't completed your questionnaire/weight check/BP check today. Is everything okay?"
2. **Identify barrier**:
   - **Technical issue**: Device malfunction, app not working, lost charger → Device support troubleshooting
   - **Forgot**: Busy, distracted → Reminder system (daily text reminder, alarm on phone)
   - **Doesn't understand importance**: Health literacy → Education ("Daily weights are the #1 way we prevent you from going back to the hospital")
   - **Feeling too sick**: Worsening symptoms → Clinical assessment (may be deteriorating)
   - **Psychosocial**: Depression, overwhelmed, giving up → Social work referral, mental health support
3. **Intervention based on barrier**
4. **Escalate if persistent non-compliance** (≥3 missed days in a week):
   - Physician notification
   - Video visit to assess (is patient appropriate for post-acute care? Needs more support? Too sick to manage?)
   - Consider home health visit if cannot engage via telehealth

**Documentation**: Non-compliance noted, barrier identified, intervention, outcome

---

### Situation 2: Medication Adherence Issues

**Red flags**:
- Medication logging <80% adherence
- Patient reports not taking medications
- Pharmacy data shows no refills picked up
- Clinical deterioration despite appropriate medications prescribed (suggests non-adherence)

**Response**:
1. **Assess reason for non-adherence**:
   - **Cost**: Cannot afford → Generic alternatives, patient assistance programs, samples
   - **Side effects**: Bothersome (cough, dizziness, nausea) → Alternative medication, dose adjustment, education on tolerance
   - **Complexity**: Too many pills, confusing schedule → Simplify regimen (combination pills, once-daily dosing), pill organizer
   - **Forgetfulness**: Busy, dementia → Reminder system, caregiver assistance, blister packs
   - **Doesn't believe needs medications**: Asymptomatic, "I feel fine" → Education on preventing future events
2. **Pharmacist consultation** (for complex adherence issues)
3. **Intervention**:
   - Pill organizer provided (free or low-cost)
   - Medication schedule simplified (work with physician to consolidate)
   - Reminder system (daily text, phone alarm, app notification)
   - Caregiver involvement (if available)
4. **Close monitoring**:
   - Daily adherence check-ins for 1 week
   - Video visit to review medications, watch patient organize pills
5. **Escalate if adherence does not improve**:
   - Home health nurse visit (medication administration supervision, teach-back)
   - Consider higher level of care if adherence critical for safety (e.g., insulin for diabetes, anticoagulation for DVT)

**Documentation**: Non-adherence identified, reason assessed, intervention, follow-up adherence monitoring

---

### Situation 3: Early Readmission (Return to Acute Care)

**Triggers**:
- Patient meets criteria for acute care re-entry (see disease-specific transition criteria in reverse)
- Examples: CHF patient with worsening dyspnea + weight gain requiring IV diuresis, COPD exacerbation requiring IV corticosteroids, pneumonia relapse requiring IV antibiotics

**Response**:
1. **Clinical assessment** (urgent video visit or phone call):
   - Verify deterioration (not just device error or patient anxiety)
   - Review recent data trends (was this sudden or gradual decline?)
2. **Decision**:
   - **Manage outpatient**: Medication adjustment, closer monitoring (daily check-ins), video visit follow-up
   - **Re-enter acute care pathway**: IV therapy needed, intensive monitoring needed
   - **ED referral**: Severe symptoms, complications, unclear diagnosis
3. **If re-entering acute care**:
   - Notify acute care team (provide post-acute summary - what treatments tried, patient response, current status)
   - Arrange acute care admission (hospital-at-home enrollment)
   - Pause post-acute monitoring (will resume after acute care completion if appropriate)
4. **Root cause analysis** (after acute episode resolves):
   - Was post-acute monitoring inadequate? (alerts not sensitive enough, missed warning signs)
   - Was transition from original acute care premature? (should have stayed in acute care longer)
   - Was intervention delayed? (urgent alert not responded to quickly enough)
   - Patient factors? (non-adherence, dietary indiscretion, new infection)
5. **Quality improvement**:
   - If early readmission (<7 days after acute care transition) → Flag for case review
   - Identify system improvements (alert threshold adjustments, transition criteria refinement, etc.)

**Documentation**: Readmission documented, root cause analysis, lessons learned for future cases

---

### Situation 4: Patient Requests Early Program Completion

**Situation**: Patient feeling well, wants to stop post-acute monitoring before scheduled completion (e.g., day 15 of 30-day CHF program)

**Response**:
1. **Assess clinical status**:
   - Review data trends (stable? improving? any concerning patterns even if not alerted?)
   - Conduct video visit (clinical assessment)
2. **Education**:
   - Explain readmission risk ("25% of CHF patients readmitted within 30 days, risk highest in first 2 weeks")
   - Explain benefit of continued monitoring ("We've already caught and fixed small problems before they became big problems")
3. **Negotiate**:
   - If patient adamant → Offer compromise (reduce monitoring intensity - daily tasks → every other day, remove Everion armband but keep weight scale, etc.)
   - Emphasize most critical tasks (CHF patient MUST continue daily weights even if nothing else)
4. **Physician discussion**:
   - If patient clinically stable AND completed majority of monitoring period (e.g., 20+ days of 30-day program) → May approve early completion
   - Ensure PCP follow-up scheduled (within 1 week)
   - Provide warning signs education (when to seek care)
5. **Document informed decision**:
   - Patient educated on readmission risk, benefits of continued monitoring
   - Patient chooses early completion (informed refusal)
   - PCP notified of early completion

**Risk**: Higher readmission risk. Balance patient autonomy vs clinical benefit.

## Program Completion Process

### Step 1: Final Video Visit

**Clinical lead conducts final visit** (1-2 days before scheduled completion):

1. **Clinical assessment**:
   - Review of systems (disease-specific)
   - Confirm symptom resolution or return to baseline

2. **Review monitoring data**:
   - Show patient their data trends over entire post-acute period
   - "Look at this - your weight is stable, your symptoms have improved, you've done a great job"
   - Celebrate successes

3. **Medication review**:
   - Final medication reconciliation
   - Confirm patient understands all medications, dosing, refill plan
   - Confirm PCP aware of medication changes

4. **Self-management education**:
   - Review warning signs (when to contact PCP)
   - Disease-specific self-management (CHF: daily weights, sodium restriction; COPD: inhaler technique, exacerbation action plan; etc.)
   - When to call 911 (emergency symptoms)

5. **Follow-up plan**:
   - Confirm PCP appointment scheduled (within 7-14 days)
   - Confirm specialist appointment if applicable
   - Confirm labs scheduled if needed
   - Provide contacts (PCP office, after-hours number, 911)

6. **Transition to primary care**:
   - "Your PCP will take over your long-term care from here"
   - "Continue your daily weights/BP checks/glucose checks at home - if you notice concerning changes, call your PCP"
   - "You've learned a lot during this program - keep up the good work"

7. **Patient feedback**:
   - Patient satisfaction survey
   - "What worked well? What could we improve?"

**Documentation**: Final video visit note, program completion note

   - COPD: Monitor for exacerbations, ensure influenza/pneumococcal vaccines up to date
   - Pneumonia: Confirm resolution with follow-up CXR, vaccines
   - HTN: Continue BP monitoring, lifestyle modifications
   - Diabetes: A1c check in 3 months, diabetes education, retinopathy screening
   - DVT: Hematology referral for anticoagulation duration decision
   - COVID: Long COVID screening if symptoms persist, PFTs if dyspnea persists

**Send via**:
- EMR direct message (if shared EMR)

### Step 3: Device Return or Retention

**Device disposition**:

1. **Return to program** (most common):
   - Everion armband (expensive, reusable)
   - VitalPatch (if used - disposable, but may be unused backups)
   - Specialized devices (spirometer, INR monitor)
   - Arrange return shipping (prepaid label provided)

2. **Patient keeps for ongoing self-monitoring**:
   - Weight scale (CHF patients encouraged to keep for lifelong daily weights)
   - BP cuff (HTN patients encouraged to keep for home BP monitoring)
   - Glucometer (Diabetes patients keep for ongoing glucose monitoring)
   - Pulse oximeter (COPD, COVID patients may keep for ongoing SpO2 checks)
   - **Practice-dependent** - some programs provide devices, others allow patient to keep

3. **Transfer to next program**:
   - If patient enrolled in another chronic disease management program (non-Carepath)
   - Coordinate device transfer

**Documentation**: Device disposition documented (returned, kept by patient, transferred)
